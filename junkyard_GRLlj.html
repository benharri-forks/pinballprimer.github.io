<h1 style="color:chocolate;">Junk Yard (Bally Williams, 1996)</h1>



<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Collect Junk whenever you can from the skill shot, lit major shots, or completing the dog video modes. Certain combinations of Junk light modes at the far right scoop; do well in these modes to earn Fireworks. Fireworks (and Junk) contribute to your end of ball bonus; Fireworks also extend the amount of time you can play Outer Space wizard mode should you get that far. Complete banks of standup targets at the top of the playfield to work toward multiball. See if the Dog shot can be backhanded from the right flipper, or if the eject from the Dog shot can be easily ski-passed to the left; if either are true, you can quickly earn Junk, bonus multipliers, and moderate points by just shooting the Dog shot all day.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<p>The phrase "five major shots" as used in the rest of this guide refers to the far left Toilet ramp, the inner left Bus ramp, the Wrecking Ball hole in the back of the game, the Dog lane on the right, and the Sewer scoop on the far right.</p>

<h3>Skill shot</h3>

<p>5 awards are shown on the display. Frequently, there will be multiple copies of the same award: most games start with 3 of the 5 options being Collect Junk. When you plunge the ball, it goes through a spinner in the shooter lane. Each spin of the spinner moves the highlighted award on the display one space. When the spinner stops, the lit award is what you get. Then, the ball is spit out of the left kickout and into the left in lane. Possible awards that can appear include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Collect Junk: gives 1 random piece of junk</li>
	<li>Super Skill Shot: the Sewer right scoop is lit for 250,000 points briefly. If you make it, the ball will be kicked out into the left in lane again with the Sewer now worth 500,000. Repeat this process until you miss, with the Sewer value increasing each time up to a maximum of 2,500,000 points.</li>
	<li>Light Time Machine: at the Sewer scoop.</li>
	<li>Light Extra Ball: also at the Sewer scoop.</li>
	<li>Spot Dog: instantly gives all 3 letters in the word Dog and lights a video mode at the Dog shot.</li>
	<li>Bonus Multiplier: increases the bonus X toward the maximum of 6x.</li>
	<li>Fireworks: usually awards 3 fireworks.</li>
	<li>Window Shopping: explained later.</li>
	<li>Points: 50,000, 100,000, 150,000, 250,000, or 500,000. Usually only appears if you've collected all of some other things (you have all Junk, bonus multiplier is 6x, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Junk and Modes, including Fireworks and Outer Space wizard mode</h3>

<p>There are 10 pieces of Junk you can collect during the game. Junk can be collected from the skill shot, by completing any video mode, or shooting lit ramps. The toilet ramp's junk collect specifically is a Choose Junk instead of Collect Junk, so you can pick up a piece that you need for an invention. You can also use the flippers to rotate the current flashing piece of junk before plunging a ball so that Collect Junk from a skill shot can be controlled as well. Various combinations of junk light various modes throughout the game: there are 7 in total, with only 4 being considered "Adventures" that qualify Outer Space, the game's wizard mode.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Cuckoo clock: lights Time Machine</li>
	<li>Hair dryer + toaster: forms Toaster Gun, which upgrades the video mode from Run From Spike to Save The Girl</li>
	<li>TV + weathervane: forms Radar, which lights the Radar Adventure</li>
	<li>Bicycle tires + fan + bath tub: forms Jalopy, which lights the Great Jalopy Race Adventure</li>
	<li>Fish bowl + completed jalopy: forms Submerger, which lights the Great Toilet Adventure</li>
	<li>Propeller + completed jalopy: forms Flying Machine, which lights the Air Tactical Combat Adventure</li>
</ul>
<p>Collecting all 10 pieces of junk and playing through all four of the Adventure modes qualifies Outer Space wizard mode. On some settings, the game will give the Toaster for you. Collecting a certain number of pieces of junk (usually 3-5) lights an extra ball at the Sewer scoop.</p>

<p><b>Time Machine</b><br>
<i>Requires Cuckoo Clock</i><br>
The time machine takes you back in time to one of a handful of preset dates for you to play a mode from a past (or future!?) Bally Williams game. 
<ul>
	<li><b>12-14-92</b> The Mamushka from The Addams Family. All switch hits anywhere in the game score 100,000 points for 20 seconds.</li>
	<li><b>01-13-93</b> Move Your Car from Creature from the Black Lagoon. The center hole is lit for a hurry-up that starts at 250,000 points and counts down, timing out at 50,000. Collect the hurry-up to lock in the value. You now have 20 seconds to shoot the center hole three more times, for 2x, 3x, and 4x the locked in value.</li>
	<li><b>10-31-95</b> Saucer Attack from Attack from Mars. This is a video mode. Use the flippers to rotate a gun and shoot descending saucers. You win 50,000 points per saucer destroyed.</li>
	<li><b>02-14-99</b> Knight Mission. Supposedly a mode from the future, though no future games ended up referencing it. This is a combo shots mode that times out very quickly (about 3 seconds) after missing a shot, which means I haven't seen too much of it...The pattern seems to go Dog shot for 250,000, then Bus shot for 300,000, then Toilet ramp for 325,000, then a hurry-up at the crane wrecking ball that counts down from 625,000 to 400,000. If you know more details I'd love to hear them...</li>
	<li><b>08-31-91</b> Payback Time from Terminator 2: Judgment Day. This mode only exists in very early versions of the game code, having been removed by Williams not long after release due to being too high scoring, so you may not ever see it. (Why it was removed entirely instead of the scoring adjusted is beyond me.) The 5 major shots in the game are each lit for 1,000,000 points. Hit all 5 in 25 seconds for a 10,000,000 point bonus.</li>
	<li><b>03:33 on the clock</b> Regardless of the date shown, if the time lands on 03:33, press both flippers quickly to play Secret Mania from The Getaway: High Speed II. This is the same as Mamushka, but switch hits only score 30,000 instead of 100,000. Much more of an easter egg than something to try for.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Video modes</b><br>
<i>Run From Spike available at start. Save The Girl requires Hair Dryer and Toaster</i><br>
Video modes are lit at the Dog lane after spelling Dog. <br>In Run From Spike, press the flippers very quickly to run away. The faster you do it, the more points you score, up to 1,000,000; it's pretty much impossible to score more than about 850,000 though. Succeeding also awards you one piece of junk. Subsequent playthroughs (level 2, etc) multiply the scoring by the level number.<br>In Save the Girl, you must use the flippers to shoot left or right, trying to hit the dog Spike three or four times before running out of time or toast (ammo). You can get more toast by shooting the scoop when it is not lit. If you fail, you earn 100,000 points plus an additional 100,000 per hit you did score, times the level number. If you succeed, you earn 500,000 points times the level number plus one piece of junk.</p>

<p><b>Radar Adventure</b><br>
<i>Requires Television and Weather Vane</i><br>
This is a mode that lasts about 45 seconds (no on-screen timer). Some, but not all, if the 5 major shots will be lit. Lit shots score 200,000 points and a Firework. If a lit shot is made, or ignored for 20 seconds, it will unlight. Collect 5 Fireworks to finish the mode.</p>

<p><b>The Great Jalopy Race</b><br>
<i>Requires Bike Tires, Fan, and Bath Tub</i><br>
Similar to Radar Adventure, but the mode only lasts 20 seconds and all shots are lit at once. Hit all 5 major shots to end the mode.</p>

<p><b>The Great Toilet Adventure</b><br>
<i>Requires Bike Tires, Fan, Bath Tub, and Fishbowl</i><br>
The Toilet Jackpot starts the game at 35,000 points and increases by 1,000 each time the ball spins around the toilet bowl at the top of the far left ramp. There's no limit to this jackpot as far as I'm aware of. When Toilet Adventure starts, you have 25 seconds to shoot the Toilet ramp or the right (Sewer) scoop a total of 5 times to collect 5 Fireworks. Every switch in the game scores the Toilet Jackpot in the meantime. Fireworks are still worth 200,000 points each.<br>Interestingly, if you have a ball save on or use a Recycle in the out lanes, the spinner in the shooter lane will also score the Toilet value per spin. This is the only way I know of to get actual points out of the plunge spinner.</p>

<p><b>Air Tactical Combat</b><br>
<i>Requires Bike Tires, Fan, Bath Tub, and Propeller</i><br>
Hit the dangling ball on the end of the Crane 5 times in 20 seconds. These 5 hits score 1,000,000, then 1,250,000, then 1,500,000, then 1,750,000, and finally 2,000,000, plus a firework each. </p>

<p>At any time during any of the 4 Adventures (Radar, Jalopy Race, Toilet, Air Combat), you can shoot the target just to the left of the Dog lane to exchange 5 pieces ot toast ammo for one more firework. In any adventure except Toilet, shooting the Sewer scoop on the right will award with a random number of pieces of toast, between 1 and 5.</p>

<p><b>Outer Space: wizard mode</b><br>
<i>Requires collecting all 10 pieces of junk and playing all 4 adventures (Time Machine and dog video modes not necessary)</i><br>
At start, the Outer Space bonus is calculated as 50,000 points times the number of Fireworks you've collected. The Outer Space bonus is awarded to you straight up, and also becomes the value of all lit shots during the wizard mode. You also receive a 10,000,000 bonus during the startup if you collected at least 20 fireworks. Outer Space is a 4-ball multiball with unlimited ball save that lasts for 3 seconds times the number of fireworks you brought into the mode. The 5 major shots are lit, and your goal is to hit them all to unlight them. However, if a shot is unlit for too long, Crazy Bob will relight it and you must hit it again. The fewer shots are lit, the faster Crazy Bob works. The mode ends if you unlight all shots successfully or run out of time. In either case, all balls drain and you being again; if you won, though, you get another 10,000,000 bonus.<br>After Outer Space ends, you're brought back to regular single ball play, but you still have all 10 of the pieces of junk, so you can immediately go back to playing Adventure modes to collect fireworks and try Outer Space again.</p>

<h3>Bus ramp</h3>

<p>At certain numbers of Bus ramp shots (2, 5, 9, 14, each one requires one more than the last), Magic Bus is available. This is a mystery award, with 5 options shown. They can be:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Big Points: 500,000 of them to be exact</li>
	<li>Light Multiball</li>
	<li>Start Multiballl</li>
	<li>Light Jackpot</li>
	<li>Light Recycle (just one of the two, usually the right one if neither were already lit)</li>
	<li>Collect Junk</li>
	<li>Light Time Machine</li>
	<li>DOG mode: instantly play the next dog video mode</li>
	<li>Bonus X: one bonus multiplier</li>
	<li>Window Shopping</li>
	<li>Autofire: the ball save is turned on for about 10 seconds.</li>
	<li>All of the Above: doesn't always appear, but when it does, it's the option on the bottom. This is not a joke option; the mystery does sometimes land here, and will actually give you all 4 of the other awards if you do.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Bus ramp shot immediately before a Magic Bus will spot a piece of junk. The Bus ramp shot immediately after a Magic Bus (starting with the second Magic Bus) will light Window Shopping at the Toilet ramp.</p>

<h3>Window Shopping</h3>

<p>Window Shopping can be started by the skill shot, Magic Bus, or lit Toilet ramp. This is another form of mystery award that takes place on the backglass of the game: you can win 3 Fireworks, light the jackpot, light an extra ball, earn a free game, or get some Toxic Waste (absolutely nothing). </p>

<h3>Crane features and multiball</h3>

<p>Complete both sets of standup targets surrounding the crane ball to qualify the Crane Hurry-up. This is a hurry-up that counts down from 50,000 to 25,000 points. Hit the crane ball again to lock in the hurry-up value and start Crane Multiball, a two-ball multiball where each hit to the crane or any surrounding target scores the locked in value. Shooting into the hole behind the crane scores 5x the locked-in value.</p>

<p>Complete one set of standup targets or hit the crane ball to earn a letter in Multiball. Sneak into the hole behind the crane ball to earn 100,000 points and three letters in the word Multiball. Spell multiball to qualify multiball at the hole (the crane will lift up). During multiball, the first shot to the crane hole with the ball out of the way scores a jackpot, equal to 1,000,000 plus 25,000 per firework collected in the game so far; lighting jackpot from a skill shot or Magic Bus qualifies this same shot, but without the multiball. After collecting a jackpot in normal multiball, the crane lowers so the ball is in the way; knock it out of the way to shoot a ball into the back hole for a super jackpot worth a static 3,000,000 points. Modes and Crane Multiball can be brought into regular multiball but not vice versa.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Junk Yard has a conventional in/out lane setup. The out lanes can be lit for Recycle by completing the corresponding standup targets in the lower left or lower right. When an out lane is lit for Recycle, the ball will be save and put in the shooter lane for another skill shot chance, and that out lane will unlight.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Various pieces of junk give between 10,000 and 100,000 points toward base bonus. You also get 25,000 in bonus per currently held firework, plus 250,000 if you've played Outer Space, plus another 250,000 if you defeated Bob within Outer Space. All of this is multiplied by the bonus multiplier, which can be as high as 6x; bonus multiplier can be increased by skill shot, Magic Bus, or completing the word Dog at the alley shot. There is no mid-ball bonus collect. All parts of bonus, including the multiplier, carry over from ball to ball.</p>

<h3>Midnight Madness</h3>

<p>If the a game is in progress at exactly 12:00 am according to the machine clock, Midnight Madness begins, which is a 3-ball multiball with unlimited ball save where all targets in the game score 75,000 points. All balls drain when the mode ends.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>Extra balls and free games can be disabled from Window Shopping.</p>
