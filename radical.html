<h1 style="color:goldenrod;">Radical! (Bally Williams, 1990)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Collect the 7 letters in the word Radical from various shots around the playfield to light one lock. After locking ball 1, repeat the process to lock ball 2. Locking 2 balls starts multiball. Jackpot is randomly worth between 3,000,000 and 10,000,000 and is collected at the left side ramp (from the upper flipper). Re-spell Radical during multiball then re-lock both balls in quick succession to relight the jackpot. Top drop targets advance bonus multiplier and expose the Snake Run hole for a mystery award. Clearing the bottom drop targets exposes a Spot Letter standup target or scores 1,000,000 points if Radical is complete.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Skill shot</h3>

<p>If the word Radical is not currently complete, the remaining letters will flash very quickly while the ball is in the shooter lane. On a full plunge, the ball should go up the left side ramp, and whichever letter is lit when the ball hits a switch about halfway up that side ramp will be spotted for you. If the ball goes around the ramp at just the right speed, it may fall into the funnel just above the upper right flipper, scoring 100,000 points and a Tail Slider. If Radical is complete and Skate or Die is lit, there is no skill shot.</p>

<h3>Radical letters</h3>

<p>There are 7 Radical letters around the game:</p>
<ul>
	<li>R: the far left Snake lane. Deceptively difficult to hit; I have the most success by trapping the ball on the left flipper, fluttering the flipper so the ball gets momentum and rolls up near the tip, and backhanding the lane.</li>
	<li>A: the near left ramp, known as the Vertical ramp</li>
	<li>D: the spinner shot through the bumpers. Just one spin is needed to collect the letter.</li>
	<li>I: the right side ramp, shot from the upper left flipper. Definitely the hardest of the seven.</li>
	<li>C: the lower drop targets. The C can be earned by either completing the bank, or hitting enough drop targets to reveal the standup target behind and hitting the standup target.</li>
	<li>A: the left side ramp, shot from the upper right flipper.</li>
	<li>L: the right orbit lane, but once again only one spin of the spinner is all it takes to earn this letter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Letters can be spotted by the Skill shot, the in lanes (before the first multiball only), or the Spot Letter target behind the lower drop targets that is lit for a few seconds when those drop targets are completed.</p>

<p>Collecting any Radical letter scores and advances the current Radical value. Radical values are 20,000 - 40,000 - 60,000 - 80,000 - 100,000 - 500,000 - 1,000,000. If about 5-7 seconds pass after collecting a letter without getting another one, the Radical value will decrease one step. When it decreases, though, the two standup targets in the near center of the playfield that face right will be lit: these are the Increase and Advance targets, which let you restore one step of the Radical value. <br>Completing the word Radical starts Skate or Die (effectively lights locks), relights the left out lane kickback if it had been used, and lights the Spot Letter target behind the lower drops for 1,000,000 points for about 15 seconds.</p>

<h3>Skate or Die: locks and multiball</h3>

<p>After completing the word Radical, Skate or Die is lit at the far left Snake lane and both side ramps. Shoot any of the three to lock a ball. You now have to complete Radical again to start Skate or Die again and light lock 2. After locking the second ball, Multiball begins. The Mega Millions jackpot is set to a random value between 3,000,000 and 10,000,000, and 2-ball multiball begins. The jackpot is collected at the left side ramp. During multiball, you can once again collect Radical letters. If multiball ends, whatever Radical letters you collected during multiball will carry over to the requirements for lighting the next multiball's first lock. If you complete Radical during multiball and can relock both balls at any of the Skate or Die locations, the jackpot will be relit at the left side ramp.</p>

<p>In most tournament settings, due to what I believe is just a different version of the game code, the jackpot will be 4,000,000 points for everyone instead of random.</p>

<h3>Tail Sliders</h3>

<p>Making the left side ramp when the second A in Radical has been collected but Skate or Die is <i>not</i> lit scores a Tail Slider. This scores 100,000 points and deposits the ball just above the upper right flipper. If you make three or more Tail Sliders in a row with each coming no more than 5 seconds after the previous, the ball will start to divert to the lock shot instead.</p>

<h3>Vertical ramp</h3>

<p>Making the near left ramp when the first A in Radical has already been collected scores 25,000 points and lights one of the in lanes alternately for 50,000 points. Making a total of 5 Vertical ramps lights the vertical ramp for extra ball very briefly. If this is missed, the right out lane will then also be lit for extra ball for a few seconds, then both will unlight.</p>

<h3>Snake Run mystery award</h3>

<p>There are two places to start Snake Run: the kickout saucer behind the upper drop targets, or the far left Snake lane. At the Snake lane, the mystery is only given if you shoot the lane 5 times to spell the word Snake. At the top drop targets, the targets will only stay down for about 10 seconds once completed before they pop back up and block the saucer again; you can also clear just 2 targets and sneak past them to get a mystery, at which point the drops will also reset. Possible awards from the mystery include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Mystery score: between 50,000 and 250,000 points. Basically worthless.</li>
	<li>1,000,000 points</li>
	<li>Tail Sliders: 25,000 points for each Tail Slider made in the game so far</li>
	<li>Verticals: 25,000 points for each Vertical Ramp made in the game so far</li>
	<li>Skate or Die: instantly light the next lock</li>
	<li>Instant Extra Ball</li>
</ul>
<p>Collecting any Snake Run award lights the right side ramp (upper left flipper shot) for 1,000,000 points.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>The left side of the table bottom on Radical is conventional, and there is a kickback in the left in lane that gets relit when Radical is completed. The right side of the table bottom is not quite standard: the divider between in and out lane is very low, and a pin against the edge of the table can help persuade the ball toward the in lane. The setup is very similar to that of Cirqus Voltaire.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is calculated as 10,000 points for each collected letter in the current spelling of Radical, plus an additional 100,000 points for each completed spelling of Radical. Bonus multiplier is advanced toward the maximum of 5x with each completion of the upper drop targets. Max bonus is 5x 400,000 = 2,000,000 points. Base bonus always carries over from ball to ball, but bonus multiplier never does, and there is no mid-ball bonus collect.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>Extra ball cannot be set to have a point value. In the manual, Specials can be set to have a value of 100,000 points. The left out lane is lit for special completely randomly at the start of some games: by default, this happens 2% of the time.</p>

<p>The in lanes can be set never to spot Radical letters.</p>

<p>Progress on Radical letters is always carried from ball to ball; this cannot be changed. However, the memory on completions of Radical for the purposes of the bonus count can be removed, which would mean spelling Radical 4 times in a single ball to earn the max base bonus.</p>

<p>The extra ball feature at the Vertical ramp can be disabled outright.</p>

<p>The exact proportion of the time that the Snake Run mystery lands on Skate or Die, Extra Ball, 1,000,000, Tail Sliders, and Verticals can each be independently adjusted.</p>
