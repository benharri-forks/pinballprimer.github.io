<h1 style="text-align:center">Indiana Jones: The Pinball Adventure (Bally Williams, 1993)</h1>

<p>This game is sometimes known as Williams Indiana Jones or Indiana Jones TPA to differentiate it from Indiana Jones (Stern Pinball, 2008).</p>

<!-- end of header to copy -->

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p><b>If playing strictly for points:</b> focus on the points from standard multiball. Hit the E-N-T drop targets in the center of the table to reveal a lock scoop; lock 3 balls for multiball. In multiball, left ramp lights jackpot; relocking balls temporarily multiplies jackpots; right ramp scores jackpots. After 3 jackpots, hit the captive ball just left of the right ramp for super jackpots.</p>

<p><b>If playing for game progression:</b> the left scoop always starts a mode if no other mode or multiball is running. It should be able to be hit with a very early backhand shot on the left flipper.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Skill shot: top lanes</h3>

<p>There is no skill shot, but the top lanes are pretty important. There are 4 in total that spell Indy. Roll through an unlit lane to light it. Lane change can be used with either flipper to rotate the lit lanes in either direction. Completing the top lanes does three things: advances the bonus multiplier (2x-4x-6x-8x), awards one of Indy's Friends which affects orbit scoring discussed much later in the guide, and relights the in lanes for Light Hand of Fate, which subsequently lights the mode start saucer on the left of the game for a mystery award. Bonus multiplier does generally carry over between balls; advancing bonus multiplier to 8x lights the mode start saucer for an extra ball and causes bonus multiplier to reset to 1x for the next ball.</p>

<h3>Locks and multiball</h3>

<p>The main lock saucer is behind the N and T drop targets in the E-N-T bank in the center of the table. If no other multiball is running, shooting a ball into this saucer always scores a lock. The drop targets will re-raise after a lock is made. Locking 3 balls starts multiball.<br>Multiball rules are similar to the jackpot rules of Fish Tales. The first goal of multiball is to collect 3 jackpots. These three jackpots have a base value of 20,000,000, then 25,000,000, then 30,000,000 points. (Some code revisions have these jackpots at 20,000,000, then 30,000,000, then 40,000,000.) The left ramp or lock saucer lights jackpot; the right ramp collects jackpot. Jackpot base value can be raised in several ways: the mode start saucer and Raise Jackpot target behind the E target add 2,000,000 to the jackpot; the captive ball drop target adds 3,000,000; the captive ball itself adds 5,000,000 for a light hit and 10,000,000 for a full hit. Relocking a ball in the lock saucer will hold it there for 15 seconds, qualifying a double jackpot. If there are 3 balls in play, relocking a second ball in the lock saucer will reset the 15 second clock and qualify a triple jackpot. Letting the 15 seconds expire or collecting a multiplied jackpot releases all relocked balls.<br>Progress on the three jackpots carries over across multiballs. After 3 jackpots are collected, the Super Jackpot round begins. Super Jackpots are collected as full hits to the captive ball. Super Jackpots can still have their values raised, but they cannot have their value multiplied. The first Super Jackpot has a base value of 80,000,000 points; the second has a base value of 90,000,000 points; starting with the third, all Super Jackpots start at 100,000,000 points. (Some code revisions have these values as 100,000,000, then 125,000,000, then 150,000,000.) <br>If multiball ends with Super Jackpot lit but before any Super Jackpots are scored, the next multiball will start with Super Jackpot lit. As soon as any Super Jackpots are scored- regardless of how many- the next multiball will reset progress, and the 3 regular jackpots must be collected again to get back to the Supers. There is no quick restart for a multiball that ends before any jackpots of any type are collected.</p>

<h3>Modes, including Eternal Life wizard mode</h3>

<p>Indiana Jones has 12 main modes, which must all be played (but not necessarily completed) prior to the special 13th mode, which is Eternal Life wizard mode. If there is no mode or multiball running, the left scoop will always be lit to start the currently flashing mode. Any ramp or orbit shot rotates which mode is flashing. Modes can be brought into multiball. All modes start with a 5,000,000 points bonus just for starting the mode. <i>Scoring earned as a result of main modes is awarded with the end of ball bonus; it is NOT given out immediately. Don't tilt a ball where a lot of modes were played!</i><br>The 12 main modes are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Castle Grunewald:</b> 30-second mode. Hit the captive ball, whose lane is positioned between the E-N-T drop targets and the right ramp. Three hits completes the mode; hits score 5,000,000, then 10,000,000, then 15,000,000 points. Full shots to the captive ball that hit the target at the end score 2x the normal value for that shot.</li>
	<li><b>Tank Chase: </b>30-second mode. Hit a total of 5 shots to other orbit. The per-shot value starts at 15,000,000 points, counts down to 5,000,000 over the first 15 second of the mode, then stays at 5,000,000 for the rest of the mode. Completing the mode with 5 shots within the time limit ends the mode and scores a 30,000,000 point completion bonus.</li>
	<li><b>Three Challenges:</b> 30-second mode. Shoot the right ramp to access the Path of Adventure mini-playfield in the top left. Roll through the 3 lit lanes in one trip to the Path to score 10,000,000, then 20,000,000, then 30,000,000 points. The three lights should be positioned as one in each pair, making it possible to clear the mode in one trip, but this mode is known to be somewhat buggy; the game sometimes lights both lanes at the same level, which are impossible to get in one trip, and the game may also just not register any mini-playfield switches during this mode if the Path of Adventure side mode has been played during the game so far.</li>
	<li><b>Choose Wisely:</b> video mode. Watch the flashing chalice, and follow it as it gets shuffled around, 3-card-monty style. Pick the correct chalice for 20,000,000 points. The shuffling is supposed to be faster if this mode is played more than once (by completing all 13 modes and looping back around), but bugs in some versions of the game code mean the chalices may shuffle slowly or not at all.</li>
	<li><b>Monkey Brains:</b> 30-second mode. All ramps and orbit shots score 8,000,000 points. There is no way to complete this mode.</li>
	<li><b>Steal the Stones:</b> 30-second mode. Shoot the right ramp to access the Path of Adventure mini-playfield. All 8 lanes are lit. Each lit lane rolled through scores 5,000,000 points. Collecting all 8 scores a 20,000,000 point bonus. If this mode is played a second (or more) time, some of the stones will be floating on the DMD, referencing that 4 of the lit lanes on the mini-playfield need to be collected twice to finish the mode.</li>
	<li><b>Escape in the Cart:</b> video mode. Watch the DMD carefully and avoid routes that have barriers. Press the left flipper to turn left, right flipper to turn right, and neither flipper to go straight. After 8 and 16 barriers passed, the speed of the game increases. The mode is completed after 25 barriers avoided. Score is 5,000,000 for starting the mode, 1,000,000 for each barrier passed, and a 10,000,000 bonus for passing 10 barriers that turns into a 30,000,000 bonus instead of the mode is completed. Some bugged math goes on here, though, because the award for a perfect play of the mode always seems to be 49,000,000.</li>
	<li><b>Rope Bridge:</b> 30-second mode. Shoot either ramp a total of 5 times, scoring 10,000,000 points each. Successfully completing the mode lights an extra ball at the mode start scoop.</li>
	<li><b>Get the Idol:</b> 30-second mode. Hit one or more drop targets a total of 4 separate times. Drop targets instantly re-raise after being hit, until they have been hit by 4 separate shots. On each shot, you get 5,000,000 points if 1 target was hit, 10,000,000 if 2 were hit, and 20,000,000 if you somehow sweep the bank of all 3 targets. After 4 separate shots, drop targets stay down, and shooting into the lock scoop scores 20,000,000 points plus a free lock for multiball.</li>
	<li><b>Streets of Cairo:</b> 30-second mode. The two orbits and two ramps score 10,000,000 points. One of the shots is inhabited by a monkey; the DMD indicates which one (from left to right: left orbit, left ramp, right ramp, right orbit). Shoot the shot with the monkey, and the objective will switch to the mode start saucer: one shot here scores 20,000,000 points, or you can pull the gun trigger to instantly end the mode for 2,000,000. On some versions of the game code, you can intentionally shoot shots the *aren't* where the monkey is, and continue to collect 10,000,000 per shot, but on other versions of the code, you can only get the 10,000,000 one per shot.</li>
	<li><b>Well of Souls:</b> a 6-ball quick multiball. The lock saucer in the center of the table scores 2,000,000 points times the number of balls in play. After 6 total shots, the drop targets will start re-raising after any award is collected. This mode continues until single ball play resumes.</li>
	<li><b>Raven Bar:</b> video mode. Indiana Jones is holding a pistol, which fires automatically and has infinite rounds. The left and right flippers shift your aim to the left or right. Each bad guy you shoot is worth 1,000,000 points. Hitting 20 bad guys makes both an extra ball and a Medallion pop up, which are collected when shot; the Medallion scores 15,000,000 points and ends the mode. If you get the 20 bad guys quickly enough, you can continue shooting bad guys before ending the mode with the Medallion. The second play of this mode, and any plays after that, require 25 bad guys instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>Playing all 12 modes will cause them all to flash on the playfield, and the next shot to the Mode Start saucer will start Eternal Life wizard mode. Eternal Life is a 6-ball multiball with 30 seconds of unlimited ball save. The goal of the game is to hit all 30 major switches on the table before single ball play resumes. This consists of the 4 top lanes, the 8 Path of Adventure switches, the 9 drop targets; the 4 ramps and loops, the mode start saucer, the 2 levels of captive ball switches, and the 2 in lanes. These switches start lit; activating any of them unlights it and scores 10,000,000 points. Collecting all 30 switches scores 1,000,000,000 points and relights all of the switches. Keep working through this process until multiball ends. I do not believe that more ball save is given when the mode restarts itself after paying out the 1,000,000,000 mega jackpot. Once single ball play resumes, the billion chance ends, and all main modes unlight, allowing the entire progression to be played through again.</p>

<h3>Path of Adventure</h3>

<p>Hitting the 9 drop targets around the table spells Adventure and lights the right ramp for a trip to the Path of Adventure. The 9 targets are split up into 3 banks. If the A-D-V or U-R-E bank is completed, it will reset, and hitting any drop target in the completed bank will spot a letter you don't have yet. If the E-N-T bank is completed, it stays down so that the lock saucer remains available, but the Raise Jackpot target next to the saucer will spot letters. Once Adventure is completely spelled, the right ramp will be lit and direct the ball to the mini-playfield in the upper left.</p>

<p>The flipper buttons can be used to tilt the upper playfield to the left or right. Each lit rollover lane in the Path of Adventure scores 5,000,000 points, plus an additional 1,000,000 for each time Adventure is completed. At first, there are 2 lit rollover lanes. Roll over a lit lane to unlight it. Unlighting all lit lanes the first time will light the second big hole in the Path of Adventure for an extra ball. After unlighting all lit lanes, a number of lanes will light up again- one more than previous set, maximum of 6 total. Starting with the second Path completion, collecting all the lit lights adds 25,000,000 to the Pit score, which is collected by going down the first hole. The Pit value maxes out at at least 100,000,000 points.</p>

<p>When the ball exits Path of Adventure through any means- either of the two big holes, or the "drain" at the bottom- a 15 second countdown starts, during which time the right ramp can be shot to get the ball back to Path of Adventure again. If ever that timer runs out, the Adventure drop targets must be completed again to reopen the opportunity. If the Adventure targets are completed during standard multiball, the right ramp will only be lit for Path of Adventure after that multiball ends.</p>

<h3>Quick Multiball</h3>

<p>In single ball play when no mode is running, the drop target in front of the captive ball will stay down for 20 seconds only after being hit 3 times. Hit the captive ball during these 20 seconds to start a 2-ball Quick Multiball. During Quick Multiball, no modes can be started, but Path of Adventure can be played; the lit rollover lane value is doubled during Quick Multiball. 5 hits to the captive ball during Quick Multiball score 10,000,000, then 15,000,000, then 20,000,000, then 25,000,000, then 30,000,000. Any hit after the 5th scores 40,000,000; the first time a 40,000,000 captive ball is scored, the out lanes will be lit alternately for Special. If a 40,000,000 captive ball is collected, the next Quick Multiball will restart at a value of 10,000,000; otherwise, progress is preserved across multiple plays of Quick Multiball.</p>

<h3>Loop Jackpot</h3>

<p>As mentioned at the top of the guide, completing the Indy top lanes collects one of Indiana Jones' friends: Shorty, Willie, Sallah, Marion, or Dr Jones. The friend will flash initially; shoot an orbit shot with a lit arrow to light it solidly. Orbits are lit with an arrow for 10 seconds after rolling through the opposite in lane. The value of a lit orbit is 1,000,000 points, plus 2,000,000 for each collected friend, for a maximum of 11,000,000 points. Once all 5 friends are solidly lit, the right ramp is lit for a Loop Jackpot, equal to the sum of all lit orbits collected so far. Supposedly, this jackpot caps at 200,000,000 points, though I have not confirmed this. The Loop Jackpot is not timed and stays lit for the rest of the ball. Collecting the Loop Jackpot or draining the ball when it is lit will unlight all friends and reset the Loop Jackpot back to 0, where it must be built up again from scratch.</p>

<h3>Dogfight</h3>

<p>Immediately after rolling through an in lane, the opposite ramp will be lit with a yellow triangle for 8 seconds. Make a ramp when it is lit in this fashion to light one of the winged green circles on the playfield. Lighting all 6 immediately starts the Dogfight hurry-up, which starts at 40,000,000 points and counts down to 0 over about 20 seconds. It is collected at the Raise Jackpot target or the lock saucer, both positioned directly behind the E-N-T targets.</p>

<h3>Super Jets</h3>

<p>Hitting the number of pop bumpers shown on the DMD starts Super Jets, at which point all pop bumpers score 1,000,000 points each for the remainder of the ball in play. The first Super Jets requires 75 bumpers; the second requires 125; after that I assume it goes up 50 each time, but am not sure if there is ever a limit. (Knowing Williams pinballs of this era, there might be a nice bug if the number of bumpers needed for Super Jets ever exceeds 255...)</p>

<h3>Hand of Fate</h3>

<p>At the start of the game, both in lanes are lit for Light Hand of Fate. If the in lanes are not lit in this way, completing the Indy top lanes will light them. Rolling through a lit in lane lights the mode start scoop on the left for a Hand of Fate mystery award for 10 seconds. The mystery award can be any of the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Points: 10,000,000 or 20,000,000</li>
	<li>Quick Multiball</li>
	<li>Loop Person: spots one of Indy's friends</li>
	<li>Light extra ball</li>
	<li>Bonus multiplier</li>
	<li>Lock ball (for standard multiball)</li>
	<li>Light Path of Adventure</li>
	<li>...others?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bottom of the table, including Narrow Escapes</h3>

<p>Indiana Jones: The Pinball Adventure has a mostly conventional in/out lane setup. In lanes light the opposite ramp for Dogfight progress and the opposite orbit for Loop Jackpot progress for a few seconds. Lit in lanes also light the mode start scoop for a Hand of Fate mystery award. Out lanes can be lit for special after collecting a 40,000,000 point captive ball "super jackpot".</p>

<p>Whenever a ball is returned to the playfield after being locked in the center scoop, it will re-enter via the Stone Idol ramp on the far right of the game, even further right than the out lane. This ball will come to the right flipper with speed, skipping over the right out lane and through a one-way gate to reach the right flipper. If a ball is going down the right out lane, it can be nudged back into play off of the post that forms the corner of the right out lane and the Stone Idol ramp exit. Doing so awards a Narrow Escape, which scores 1,000,000 points the first time and an additional 1,000,000 each subsequent time, with no limit that I have ever encountered.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Base bonus is calculated on switch hits and I do not know the exact formula. Base bonus is the only part of bonus that is affected by bonus multiplier, which is most frequently advanced by completing the Indy top lanes but can also be advanced from a Hand of Fate mystery award. All scoring earned in any of the 12 main modes is also added to the end of ball bonus, which means the bonus can regularly be in the hundreds of millions of points, and tilting is almost always a very bad idea. There is no bonus holdover or mid ball bonus collect. Bonus multiplier is held from ball to ball unless it is maxed out at 8x.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>The game manual indicates that a special is worth 1,000,000 points in competition/novelty play. This seems incredibly low and I expect it to be incorrect, as it is in several other mid-90s Williams manuals. 100,000,000 points would probably be a better award for a Special. I am not aware of any setting that allows extra balls to be assigned a point value.</p>

<p>Most timers in the game are adjustable.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Ball save timers default to 5 seconds at the start of a ball, 3 seconds at the start of Quick Multiball, and 10 seconds at the start of standard multiball. Presets range from 2 to 15 seconds, or they can be customly set to between 1 and 60.</li>
	<li>Following an in lane, the opposite orbit is lit for 10 seconds and the opposite ramp is lit for 8, by default. Presets very from 5 to 20 seconds; the game allows for any value from 1-120 seconds.</li>
	<li>For Quick Multiball, defaults are 3 drop target hits to qualify, then a 20 second timer to start. Presets vary from 1-5 hits and 10-30 seconds. The game allows for 1-25 hits and 5-120 seconds.</li>
	<li>All timed modes can be set to any length from 1 to 120 seconds. Default is 30, and difficulty installs vary from 20 to 50.</li>
	<li>Path of Adventure can start at any level from 1 to 4 (between 2 and 5 rollovers lit), and the timer for continuing Path of Adventure after ball leaves can be 1-120 seconds or disabled outright. Disabling the timer means every single trip back to the Path requires completing the Adventure drops first.</li>
	<li>Hand of Fate mystery can be lit for 1-120 seconds or indefinitely.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first Super Jets can require 1-255 hits. Default 75. Difficulty presets vary from 50-100.</p>

<p>Brief ball savers can be turned on (~2 seconds each) for balls that drain in the left out lane immediately after hitting a center drop target, or for balls that drain out the right out lane when being released from the Stone Idol ramp on the right.</p>
