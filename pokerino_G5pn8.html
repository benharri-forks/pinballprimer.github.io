<h1>Pokerino (Williams, 1978)</h1>



<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>If playing exclusively for points, this is a one-shot game- find the left orbit all day for bonus multipliers, trips back to the top of the table for more base bonus from star rollovers, and a spinner that's lit for 1,000 points per spin whenever the center Joker drop target is down. If playing for extra balls/specials, complete the Ace star rollovers, King captive ball, Queen and Jack drop targets, and 10 star rollover as many times as possible to light letters in Pokerino, which eventually lights extra balls at the left orbit and specials at the out lanes.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Playing cards</h3>

<p><i>Aces:</i> the four star rollovers at the top of the game each score 1,000 points and a bonus advance. Light the Aces by pressing each star rollover. The lane in the upper right of the game scores 5,000 points and increases the bonus multiplier toward the maximum of 5x. Lighting all 4 Aces will in turn light the upper right lane green; it now scores 20,000 points and a Pokerino letter in addition to the bonus multiplier, instead of just 5,000 points. Ace progress and completion is kept for the whole game.</p>

<p><i>Kings:</i> Hitting a captive ball around the loop scores 1,000 points and lights one of the 4 Kings. Lighting the 4th King increases the value of each captive ball hit to 10,000 points for the rest of the game. Hitting all 4 captive balls around the loop during a single ball in play scores a Pokerino letter and returns the captive balls to the starting position. Lit Kings in progress carry over from ball to ball, so the 4th King may not always happen at the same time as the Pokerino letter. </p>

<p><i>Queens:</i> each drop target down in the upper right 4-bank scores 1,000 points and a bonus advance. The first completion of this bank scores 10,000 points and lights the green 4 Queens inserts. The second completion of this bank and any completion after that scores 20,000 points and a Pokerino letter. In a 3-ball game, the 4 Queens light stays on from ball to ball, but in a 5-ball game, it does not, so to get Pokerino letters from the Queens in a 5-ball game, you must complete this bank twice. This bank of targets resets between balls, so you always have to get the initial 4 Queens light within a single ball.</p>

<p><i>Jacks:</i> two drop targets in each of the lower left and lower right. Each drop target down scores 1,000 points and a bonus advance. The first completion of the four targets scores 10,000 points and lights the 4 Jacks green inserts; further completions score 20,000 points and a Pokerino letter each. The 4 Jacks lights always stay on from ball to ball, but the drop targets themselves reset for each ball.</p>

<p><i>Tens:</i> the Tens correspond to a single star rollover smack in the center of the table, just above the Joker Target structure. Each time this star rollover is registered, 1,000 points and a bonus advance are scored, and one of the Tens is lit. Collecting all 4 Tens scores 10,000 points and a Pokerino letter, and also lights the green 4 Tens inserts, but additional hits of this star rollover still score 1,000 points.</p>

<p><i>Joker drop target:</i> a sucker target facing the flippers in the dead center of the game. This target is raised at the start of each ball, and it is re-raised whenever the Ace, King, or Ten lights are lit or whenever the Queen or Jack drop targets are completed. Knocking the target down scores 5,000 points OR 10,000 points times the number of green inserts lit, for a maximum of 50,000. Also, the left spinner is lit for 1,000 points per spin instead of 100 only when the Joker target is currently down.</p>

<p>Lighting all five green inserts at the same time lights the left orbit for 2 extra balls or 50,000 points, and lights the upper right lane for a Special.</p>

<h3>Pokerino letters</h3>

<p>Pokerino letters are awarded by playing card features as described above. Letters are only given one at a time, except for a setting within the game that can allow the first two letters to be awarded together. Spelling Poker lights the left orbit for an extra ball or 50,000 points.* Spelling Pokerino lights the out lanes for special, alternating with each 10-point switch hit. Pokerino letters are always carried from ball to ball.</p>

<p>*The game manual indicates that both the Poker extra ball and the green inserts extra ball can be stacked at the left orbit, for a total of 3 extra balls awarded. It does not confirm whether the 50,000 points can be recollected as well.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Pokerino has no in lanes and two flippers on each side. "Double action" flipper buttons allow for stage flipping, moving only the inner two flippers if the button is partially pressed. A ball can drain between the two flippers on a given side if the button is fully pressed so that all four flippers are raised. Out lanes score 1,000 points and can be lit for special alternately by spelling Pokerino.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is advanced by hitting any Queen or Jack drop target, or any Ace or Ten star rollover. Bonus multiplier is advanced from the left orbit or the upper right lane. Max bonus is 5x 29,000 = 145,000 points. Base bonus can never be carried from ball to ball. Bonus multiplier is always preserved between balls, unless it has been maxed out at 5x, in which case it will reset back to 1x. There is no mid-ball bonus collect.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>Specials can award a free game, an extra ball, or 50,000 points. Extra balls can also award 50,000 points instead. As far as I have encountered, there is no limit to extra balls per ball in play.</p>

<p>The first two Pokerino letters can be awarded separately rather than together.</p>
