<h1>King Rock / King Kool (Gottlieb, 1972)</h1>

<p>King Rock is the 4-player version. King Kool is the otherwise-identical 2-player version.</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>It's all about the bonus! K-I-N-G top lanes and targets give 1,000 points and a bonus advance. Collecting all four letters increases bonus multiplier from 2x to 3x on the final ball of the game, or from 1x to 2x on any other ball. Spinners and 10 point bumpers advance bonus; backhand the spinners for best results. Ignore the center standup target unless it's lit for Open Gate.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>King letters</h3>

<p>The K-I-N-G letters each have their own top lanes and lower standup targets. Hit a lit letter to collect and unlight it. K-I-N-G lanes and targets always score 1,000 points and a bonus advance. Spell King to earn double bonus on balls 1-4 and turn your free double bonus into triple bonus on ball 5.</p>

<h3>Bumpers</h3>

<p>Outer bumpers always score 10 points and the center bumper always scores 100.</p>

<h3>Spinners</h3>

<p>Spinners always score 10 points. Every tenth 10-point switch- which can include outer bumpers or the spinners- advances the bonus. It's best to backhand these spinners whenever possible, as cross-playfield shots tend to hit a 10-point bumper behind the spinner and be deflected right back the way it came, usually stopping the spinner in the process.</p>

<h3>Upper side lanes</h3>

<p>Always score 1,000 points and a bonus advance.</p>

<h3>Center standup target</h3>

<p>Always scores 500 points. If the current base bonus is 3,000, 5,000, 7,000, 9,000, 11,000, or 13,000, the target will be lit purple for Opens Gate, which is a gate in the right out lane that sends the ball back into the shooter lane. If the current base bonus is exactly 8,000 points, this target is lit for a special.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>There are no in lanes or slingshots; King Rock has two flippers on each side. They are controlled with the same flipper button and cannot be stage flipped, so there is no way to trap a ball on an inner flipper. Balls can be drained between the two flippers on a given side. Out lanes score 1,000 points and a bonus advance.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is advanced by K-I-N-G lanes or targets, every tenth 10-point switch, the upper side lanes, and the out lanes. The first step of base bonus is not given for free; it is possible to drain with 0 bonus. Max base bonus is 15,000 points. Spelling King lights double bonus. Double bonus is awarded for free on the final ball of the game; spelling King on the final ball is worth triple bonus, then. There is no bonus holdover or mid ball bonus collect.<br>There also are no extra balls available.</p>
