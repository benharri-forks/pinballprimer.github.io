<h1 style="text-align:center">Time Fantasy (Williams, 1983)</h1>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Shoot the left orbit all day to complete the top lanes repeatedly, increasing their value as well as the Fantasy Time playfield multiplier. Spell Time at the narrow upper left lane to start Fantasy Time, which is a minimum of 30 seconds of unlimited ball save with whatever playfield multiplier you built up with 1-2-3-4-5 completions. The length of Fantasy Time can be extended by making the 1 top lane, completing Fantasy, or making lit in lanes. Lighting all 7 Fantasy targets also advances the bonus multiplier.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>Lanes score 1,000 points and a bonus advance. Roll through an unlit lane to light it. Lit lanes can be rotated via lane change with the right flipper only. If no lanes are lit, one lane will be flashing, and the flashing lane will rotate every few seconds. Go through the flashing lane to spot a letter in the word Time in addition to lighting that lane. Light all 5 lanes to score and advance the lit value at the top of the playfield (10,000 - 30,000 - 50,000 - 90,000) as well as advance the playfield multiplier that will be in effect the for the next Fantasy Time, up to a max of 5x. The 1-2-3-4-5 completion value will carry over from ball to ball, but only until a 90,000 completion is collected; from that point on the value will reset between balls.</p>

<p>Whether lit or not, going through lane 1 adds 10 seconds to the next Fantasy Time timer.</p>

<h3>Left orbit</h3>

<p>Increases the value of the Mushroom Jump loop, but more importantly, takes you back to the top of the table for more top lanes.</p>

<h3>Time lane</h3>

<p>A narrow lane just to the right of the left orbit shot. The letters in Time constantly scan. Hit the target at the back of the lane to score 5,000 points and receive the currently lit letter. At random points, the target is lit for an additional 50,000 points as well. Spelling the word Time starts Fantasy Time mode.</p>

<h3>Fantasy Time</h3>

<p>Fantasy Time is a mode that starts when the word Time is completed at the Time Lane. Fantasy Time lasts a minimum of 30 seconds; this is increased by 5 seconds per completions of the Fantasy targets and per lit in lane, and 10 seconds each time the ball goes through top lane #1, up to a maximum of 99 seconds. During Fantasy Time, there is unlimited ball save, and the playfield multiplier shown in the left orbit (which was previously built up by 1-2-3-4-5 completions) will be in effect. There is no penalty for drained balls, you get to plunge again; this can be skillfully and intentionally done to get the ball to the top of the table faster so that you can earn more 1-2-3-4-5 completions during Fantasy Time. Playfield multiplier can continue to be increased during Fantasy Time; a top lanes completion can very quickly be worth 5x 90,000 = 450,000 points. The timer for Fantasy Time cannot be increased while the mode is running; starting Fantasy Time locks in how long it will run for. Time letters can be earned during Fantasy Time, making it easier to start a future Fantasy Time; I am not sure what happens if you complete another spelling of Time while Fantasy Time is running, though. When Fantasy Time ends, the built-up playfield multiplier is reset. Additional Fantasy Times after the first one start at a base length of 15 seconds instead of 30 and must be built up again.</p>

<h3>Fantasy targets</h3>

<p>Targets score 1,000 points and a bonus advance. Hit an unlit target to light it. Spelling Fantasy scores 20,000 points, increases the end of ball bonus multiplier in the sequence 2x-3x-5x-10x, and adds 5 seconds to the next Fantasy Time.</p>

<h3>Mushroom Jump horseshoe lane</h3>

<p>The Mushroom Jump value starts at 10,000 points. Making the left orbit increases the Mushroom value in the sequence 10,000 - 20,000 - 30,000 - 40,000 - 50,000 - 100,000. Shooting the horseshoe in the lit direction scores and advances the Mushroom value. Shooting the horseshoe in the wrong direction lowers the Mushroom value one step. Collecting 100,000 points from a single Mushroom Jump will light the out lanes alternately for a Special.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Time Fantasy has a conventional in/out lane setup. Out lanes score 5,000 points and a bonus advance, or Special when lit. In lanes score 1,000 points and 2 bonus advances, or 10,000 points and 5 Fantasy Time seconds when lit. Bumpers and slingshots alternate which in and out lanes are lit.</p>

<p>By default, there is a center peg between the flippers to help save center drains.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is advanced by any Fantasy target, any 1-2-3-4-5 lane, any out lane, and the rollover switches in the Mushroom Jump. In lanes give 2 bonus advances. Max base bonus is 39,000 points. If base bonus is maxed out, further bonus advances award 2,000 points each. Each completion of Fantasy increases bonus multiplier in the sequence 2x-3x-5x-10x. Max bonus is 10x 39,000 = 390,000 points. Base bonus can never be carried from ball to ball. Bonus multiplier does carry over from ball to ball by default. There is no mid-ball bonus collect.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>There is a point value setting for Specials, but I have not confirmed the exact value. It is likely 50,000 or 100,000 points. There are no extra balls in the game at all.</p>

<p>There are 10 different settings for how quickly the Time lights can scan. The factory setting is #7, where #10 is the easiest.</p>

<p>Bonus multiplier can be set not to carry between balls.</p>
