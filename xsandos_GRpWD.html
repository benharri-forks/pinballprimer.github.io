<h1>X's & O's (Bally, 1984)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>When it's your turn, step up to the machine and be ready to plunge quickly, because the skill shot is very valuable and times out about 5-10 seconds after the ball is fed to the shooter lane.<br>Early in a game, shoot at the tic tac toe targets around the middle playfield to fill in tic tac toe cards, since each completed card scores a minimum of 90,000 in bonus that carries from ball to ball.<br>Once the bonus is satisfactory, complete the upper right drop targets until one completion less than what it would take to light the special, then shoot the far left upper lane as many times as possible while it's at max value.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Skill shot</h3>

<p>The skill shot is a precise-power plunge that is only lit for a certain amount of time- 5 or 8 seconds on standard settings. The plunge needs to clear the one-way gate about 2/3 of the way up the lane, but then fall into the side branching lane without triggering the switch immediately above the branch.<br>The skill shot is worth 100,000 until it is made; then 200,000, until made again; then special, which is only worth 50,000. If extra balls are on or the game is more than 3 balls, additional skill shots can either be all special, all 200,000, or cycle through the order again.</p>

<h3>Upper drop targets and far left upper lane</h3>

<p>When no arrows are lit, the drop targets score 5,000 points each, and the upper left lane also scores 5,000 points. <br>Each completion of the drop targets increases the value of completing the drop targets by 30,000 and the value of the left lane by 20,000. After a certain number of drop target completions, both the drops and left lane will be lit for special- avoid this, as collecting the special resets the value of both back to nil. Depending on game settings, these features are lit for special after either 4, 5, 6, or 7 drop target completions- learn what the setting is on your local machine and complete the drop targets one fewer time than that to keep the leftmost upper lane at the highest possible value.</p>

<h3>Tic tac toe board, bonus, and the other top lanes</h3>

<p>There are nine standup targets around the middle of the playfield that correspond to the nine boxes of the tic tac toe board set into the playfield. Each target has a small diagram showing which of the 9 boxes that target fills in. The left bank corresponds to the left column of boxes, the center bank deals with the center column, and the right bank fills in the right column. </p>

<p>In front of each bank is a light showing whether X or O is the currently selected symbol. Hitting a target will put the designated symbol in the box associated with that target. This includes overwriting the current symbol with the opposite one, unless the box on the board corresponding to the hit target is part of a 3-in-a-row tic-tac-toe. This makes it easier to fill a board with all one symbol, but if there are multiple different 3-in-a-rows on the current board with opposite symbols, it is impossible to convert them all to the same symbol.</p>

<p>Completing any 3-in-a-row connection advances the 3-in-a-row bonus by 20,000 points, up to a maximum of 380,000. Completing any board by putting a symbol in every square, no matter how many tic-tac-toes there are, advances the card bonus by 90,000 points, up to a maximum of 270,000. <br>Completing a 4th board scores a special. Completing a board with the same symbol in every box also scores a special, and lights a letter in TIC-TAC-TOE on the backglass. If your letter finishes TIC-TAC-TOE, two more replays are awarded.</p>

<p>If all three targets in a bank have their boxes filled with the same symbol- that is, a vertical tic-tac-toe has been completed- those standup targets will light for 5,000 each instead of the normal 1,000.</p>

<p>Completing three tic-tac-toes on a ball lights the middle of the top lanes for extra ball. Collecting the extra ball instead lights the lane for 50,000 points, which can be collected repeatedly for the rest of the ball.<br>Completing five tic-tac-toes on a ball lights the rightmost of those top lanes for special. Collecting that special will then light the lane for a repeatable 100,000 for the rest of the ball. Once both of these are lit, to try to shoot up the 50,000/extra ball lane from the right flipper as often as possible and then nudge the ball into the special lane to get the 100,000 on the way down. Due to a one way gate, the 100,000 lane cannot be backed into from the bumpers. <br>The rollovers in these two lanes score 5,000 and 10,000 respectively when not lit for something else.</p>

<p>All specials score 50,000 points and all extra balls score 25,000 points on novelty/competition settings, if they are not disabled outright.</p>

<p>End of ball bonus is equal to the card bonus, plus the 3-in-a-line bonus, plus 5,000 points for each symbol lit on the current card. All bonuses and all progress on the current board are carried to the next ball.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>The left in lane and out lane have a reversed setup. The lane closer to the edge of the table feeds the flipper, while the lane closer to the flipper drops into the drain. Look out for the possibility of nudging a ball from the out lane through the gate and back toward the flipper. There is a one way gate above the left flipper preventing the ball from rolling back into the out lane.<br>The in lane scores 5,000 points and the out lane scores 500. They cannot be lit in any way.</p>

<p>The right in lane and out lane are in the conventional order, but there's a saucer where the curve of the in lane would be. A ball going down the out lane can be nudged off the post in the bottom corner of the table and into this saucer. A ball landing in this saucer will score 5,000 points for each symbol on the current card, then be kicked out through a one way gate into the in lane. <br>The right in lane scores 1,000 points and the right out lane scores 500. Neither can be lit in any way.</p>

<p>All four in/out lane rollovers switch what the currently lit tic tac toe symbol is between X and O. The slingshots- which are passive switches and do not actively kick the ball away- score 30 points each and every hit also alternates the lit X or O symbol.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>The skill shot makes a beep every half second. Settings for the skill shot time include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>10 beeps for any skill shot</li>
	<li>15 beeps for any skill shot</li>
	<li>20 beeps for 100,000, then 15 beeps for 200,000, then 10 beeps for special</li>
	<li>30 beeps for 100,000, then 20 beeps for 200,000, then 10 beeps for special</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, skill shots after the third successful one can follow any of these patterns:</p>
<ul>
	<li>always special</li>
	<li>alternating 200,000 and special</li>
	<li>always 200,000</li>
	<li>repeating the 100,000-200,000-special cycle</li>
</ul>

<p>The extra ball top lane can be lit after 3 or 4 successful tic-tac-toes on the current ball. The special top lane is always lit after 5 tic-tac-toes.</p>

<p>The number of drop target completions required for special to light can be 4, 5, 6, or 7. On each of these settings, the max value before special will be 60,000-80,000-100,000-120,000 for the left lane, and 90,000-120,000-150,000-180,000 for the drop targets for 4, 5, 6, or 7 completions to special respectively.</p>

<p>Beating the high score to date or rolling the score over at 10,000,000 points earns an additional award of three (default), two, one, or zero free games.</p>
