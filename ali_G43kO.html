<h1 style="color:yellow;">Ali (Stern Electronics, 1980)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>First, complete the top drop targets 4 times to max the bonus multiplier at 5X, since bonus X always carries over from ball to ball.<br>Second, spell Greatest at the standup targets around the playfield, the in lanes, and the star rollover near the flippers. <br>From here, shoot the left drop targets from the right flipper to advance the completion value up to 80,000, and shoot the collect bonus saucer from the left flipper to repeatedly cash in a full bonus that can be as high as 140,000.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>A-L-I saucers</h3>

<p>Each scores 500 points and lights the corresponding letter. Completing A-L-I once lights the L saucer for 5,000 points. Completing A-L-I a second time lights the L saucer for 10,000 points. After special is lit by spelling A-L-I once and G-R-E-A-T-E-S-T twice, the L saucer is one of the places it can be collected. </p>

<h3>G-R-E-A-T-E-S-T letters</h3>

<p>G, R, E, A , and T standup targets around the top and right side of the playfield score 500 points and a bonus advance. S and T on the in lanes score 3,000 points and a bonus advance. The star rollover near the flippers rotates between being lit for G, R, E, S, or points. Spelling Greatest once dramatically boosts the value of the left drop targets, explained below, and also lights an extra ball at the top horseshor shot. Spelling Greatest twice in addition to spelling Ali once lights the specials on the out lanes and the L saucer.</p>

<h3>Top drop targets</h3>

<p>Score 500 points each. The first completion lights 2X bonus and scores 5,000 points; each completion after that increases the bonus by 1X and scores 5,000 more points than the previous, maximum 20,000. <br>Bonus multiplier always carries over from ball to ball in this game, so it's extremely important to pick off these targets as many times as possible early on.</p>

<h3>Back left horseshoe lane</h3>

<p>Has a spinner that scores 2,000 points per spin, but even that scoring is not really viable compared to other things in the game, and it's quite hard to rip the spinner particularly well due to the angle of the shot and the lane itself. After completing Greatest once, this lane is lit for extra ball.</p>

<h3>Left side lane</h3>

<p>Scores 1,000 points, plus an additional 1,000 points for every letter in G-R-E-A-T-E-S-T that has been collected. Once Greatest has been completed once, this lane is worth 9,000 for the rest of the game.</p>

<h3>Left drop targets</h3>

<p>Each target down scores 500 points. Completing the bank scores the lit star value times the number of G-R-E-A-T-E-S-T letters collected. The star value starts at 4,000 and increases by 2,000 each time the bank is completed, to a maximum of 10,000. If Greatest has been completed once, every clear of this target bank starting with the 4th scores 80,000 points!<br>These targets can be shot with either flipper, though right is much easier. Shots from the flipper toward this bank frequently deflect into the upper drops as well.</p>

<h3>Bonus and the collect bonus saucer</h3>

<p>Standup targets, in lanes, and star rollovers each give 1 bonus advance. Out lanes give 3 bonus advance. Notice that each bonus advance is worth 2,000 points in base bonus instead of the usual 1,000. Max bonus is 5x 28,000 = 140,000 points.</p>

<p>The right lane and saucer are always available for a full bonus collect, including the multipliers. This does not drain the base bonus, so the shot is repeatable with no need to rebuild the bonus after each collect. After 5X bonus has been achieved and the bonus has been built even moderately, shoot for this saucer all day to repeatedly pick up collects of up to 140,000 points each.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Ali has a conventional in/out lane and flipper setup. Out lanes score 5,000 points and 3 bonus advances, and can be lit for special once Ali has been spelled once and Greatest has been spelled twice. In lanes score 3,000 points and one bonus advance. Left in lane also lights the S in Greatest, and the right in lane lights a T. (A setting in the game determines if the T in lane gives both Ts at once, or just one at a time.)</p>

<h3>Other settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>On 5 ball play, the extra ball is lit when both Ali and Greatest have been completed, rather than just Greatest. </p>

<p>The special can be lit after just one completion each of Ali and Greatest, instead of needing one Ali and two Greatest. Ths special can also be lit in all three places at once (L saucer and the two out lanes) or rotate between them with bumper hits.</p>

<p>Special can be set to award a free game, extra ball, 100,000 points, or nothing. Extra ball cannot be set to points, and is merely either on or off.</p>
