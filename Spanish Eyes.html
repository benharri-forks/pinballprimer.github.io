<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>If extra ball or replays are on and you care about them: take care to finish A-B-C-D-E on the plunges to earn a special, which can be set to extra ball or free game. Collect 1-6 numbers to add to the value of the saucer in the center of the playfield; when all 6 are collected, shoot the horseshoe for an extra ball or replay.</p>

<p>If specials are off and give no award, don't worry about top lanes: try to hit the On Bumpers switch on the plunge, then collect exactly 5 of the 6 stars, then go crazy on the 5,000 point horseshoe or 5,000 point saucer. Don't finish the numbers or the horseshoe will give you a very special nothing and undo your work on the numbers.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>"On Bumpers" button</h3>

<p>Lights all three green bumpers (two at the top, one at the bottom between the flippers) for 100 points. They're worth 10 otherwise. The red bumper is always worth 100 points.</p>

<h3>A-B-C-D-E lanes</h3>

<p>Any lane scores 1,000 points, lit or not. Completing A-B-C-D-E scores a special, which can be set to free game, extra ball, or nothing. If playing in a tournament, know whether extra balls are on before making a decision to play for completing the letter lanes. If the special award is meaningful to you, be sure to pick off the five letters on the five plunges, because it's very difficult to get letter lanes on subsequent trips back up the table.</p>

<h3>1-6 stars, center saucer, and horseshoe</h3>

<p>Six yellow standup targets around the playfield. 1-4 are near the top of the playfield above and around the bumpers, while 5 and 6 are much lower. Hitting any target lights it and scores 1,000 points, whether it was lit or not. <br>The center saucer is worth 1,000 points per lit number (maximum 6,000), or 500 points if no numbers are lit.</p>

<p>The horseshoe shot scores 5,000 points when not lit.</p>

<p>Completing 1-6 lights the out lanes for the rest of the ball and lights the center horseshoe for special instead of the 5,000. Collecting the special resets the 1-6 lights to be collected again. <br>If playing casually or if it's a tournament and extra balls are on, weigh the short term reward of the special with the long term reward of being able to keep picking off the saucer and horseshoe for big points. <br>If the special doesn't matter to you and you're playing strictly for point efficiency, avoid the decision altogether and try to avoid collecting the last number in 1-6 so that you don't accidentally collect a special in the first place and undo your number progress.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Hoo boy.</p>

<p>There are out lanes on either side. They score 1,000 points normally, or 5,000 points when lit. Out lanes are lit by completing the 1-6 numbers on that ball.</p>

<p>The flippers are very far apart and there is an entire bumper in between them. Below the bumper is actually a pretty small place for the ball to drain: some pretty impressive and weird looking saves are possible on Spanish Eyes if the ball hits this bumper from below in such a way that it can build up momentum in the space around the bumper and "walk" itself back up into play. Don't give up on a ball too soon on this game, and if the ball is headed in what looks like a bad direction, try to nudge the pop bumper into it, because you never know what can happen.</p>

<p>The ball can drain underneath the flippers. When trying to save the ball by encouraging it to hit the between-flippers bumper, keep the flippers down as much as possible lest the ball hit a bumper, find the underside of a flipper, and be sent where the sun don't shine. </p>

<h3>Miscellanea</h3>

<p>There is no end of ball bonus. Tilt ends current ball, not the whole game.</p>

<p>Progress toward A-B-C-D-E and 1-2-3-4-5-6 is carried over from ball to ball. The only thing that gets reset on this table between balls is the lit out lanes. </p>
