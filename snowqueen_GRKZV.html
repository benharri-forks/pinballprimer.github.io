<h1 style="color:lightblue;">Snow Queen / Snow Derby (Gottlieb,1970)</h1>

<p>Snow Queen is the 4-player version. Snow Derby is the 2-player version. The two games have identical rules and scoring.</p>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Since more and more things are lit with each passing ball, use the first balls to figure out how to minimize chances of a house ball near the end of the game. Effectively, bonus is advanced once for every 100 points are scored during the ball; early on, focus on the 10 points/spin spinner to build toward that quota, but shoot up to the top of the table to take advantage of lit bumpers and saucers once they actually are lit in the late game.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<p>The four top saucers all score 10 points, or 50 when lit.</p>

<p>The standup targets in the top corners of the playfield score 50 points for the upper target in each pair, and 10 points for the lower target in each pair.</p>

<p>Red (center) bumper and blue (outer) bumpers all score 1 point, or 10 points when lit.</p>

<p>Side lanes score 50 points. The left side lane is bidirectional. The right side lane is closed at the bottom because it connects to the shooter lane for a replunge, so it can only be entered from above.</p>

<p>Both spinners, just inside the edge of the table from the side lanes, score 10 points per spin. These are the best source of points until most or all of the top saucers and bumpers are lit.</p>

<p>A standup target in the lower right scores 10 points.</p>

<p>Snow Derby has a conventional in/out lane setup. Out lanes always score 50 points and in lanes always score 10.</p>

<h3>When are things lit?</h3>

<p>On ball 1 and 2 of a 5-ball game, only the leftmost saucer is lit, and none of the bumpers are lit. <br>On ball 3, the two left saucers are lit. <br>On ball 4, the three left saucers and the center red bumper are lit.<br>On ball 5, all 4 saucers and all 3 bumpers are lit.</p>

<p>Balls 1, 2, and 3 in a 3-ball game follow the scoring/lit features rules of balls 3, 4, and 5 of a 5-ball game, respectively.</p>

<h3>End of ball bonus</h3>

<p>Every 10 points scored advances the light around the snowboard track by one position. Every 10 advances- so, in practice, every 100 points- completes a lap of the snowboard circuit, increasing the bonus count by one step. Each bonus advance scores 200 points on the final ball of the game, 100 points on the second-to-last ball of the game, and 50 points on all other balls. Functionally, this means that the end of ball bonus is more or less a 1.5x, 2x, or 3x playfield multiplier depending on the current ball, which helps show just how important it is to score well and not house ball on the last two balls of the game.</p>
