<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Complete the drop targets 4 times to advance to 5x bonus and max out the value of the top saucer. Complete the five standup targets in the upper right to max out spinner value. Once you do both of these things, go for additional completions of the drop targets if the special can be earned more than once; if the drop target special is one per ball, collect it then shift focus to whichever spinner is lit for 2,000 points per spin.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top saucer</h3>

<p>Always scores 5,000 points at the start of the ball, but the value can be increased to 10,000 then 20,000 then 30,000 via completions of the drop targets. </p>

<h3>Drop targets</h3>

<p>Any drop target down scores 500 points. The first four completions of the drop targets advance the bonus multiplier. Any completions after that award a special. <br>For the first completion, only the 2nd and 4th targets are required for the 2x bonus. For the second completion, only targets 1-3-5 are needed to earn 3x bonus. For the third completion, targets 1-2-4-5 are needed for the 4x bonus. After that, each completion requires all 5 targets in the bank.<br>The first three completions of the drop targets also increase the top saucer value, to 10,000 then 20,000 then 30,000. Advancing to 4x bonus (3 completions) lights the right out lane for a special.</p>

<h3>Upper right standup targets and spinners</h3>

<p>The upper right standup targets score 1,000 points and a bonus advance. Hitting an unlit target also lights that colour at both the standup targets and the spinners.<br>The base spinner value is 200 points per spin. The white and red standup targets each increase the value of the left spinner by 400 per spin. The green and yellow targets each increase the value of the right spinner by 400 per spin. The purple target will light one of the two spinners for an additional 1,000 per spin, alternating between the two with each bumper or slingshot hit. After hitting all 5 targets, one spinner will always be worth 1,000/spin, and the other will always be worth 2,000/spin. Lighting all 5 colours once also lights the right in lane for an extra ball. After lighting all 5 colours, the inserts near the standup targets will unlight, but the spinners will keep their value; hitting all 5 standup targets a second time scores a special. </p>

<h3>Left orbit</h3>

<p>Behind the left spinner is a star rollover button. This button scores just 100 points, but advances the value of the left in lane.</p>

<h3>Upper slingshots</h3>

<p>On either side of the middle of the table, just below the entrance to each spinner, the switches in the walls are actual slingshots that will fire the ball away. Each activation of either of these slingshots scores 1,000 points and a bonus advance.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>On the left side, there is no out lane (!), only an in lane. This lane scores 2,000 points and a bonus advance. The point value of this lane can be increased to 4,000, then 6,000, then 8,000 points by hitting the star rollover in the left orbit 1, 2, or 3 times. <br>The right side has in and out lanes in the conventional locations, but the in lane rail is cut off- balls going through the in lane can dribble out of play with an unlucky bounce, and balls going through the out lane can be bounced back into play off a post in the out lane area. Also, care should be taken when attempting to trap the ball on the right flipper, as the ball could roll up the in lane rail and fall into the out lane. The in lane scores 3,000 points and 3 bonus advance, and can be lit for extra ball by completing the 5 standup targets once. The out lane scores 5,000 points and 3 bonus advance, and can be lit for a special by making it to 4x bonus via 3 completions of the drop targets.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is advanced once by the upper right standup targets, upper slingshots, and left in lane. The right in lane and out lane advance the bonus 3 times. Bonus multiplier is advanced by the drop targets as described above. Max bonus is 5x 19,000 = 95,000 points. Bonus and bonus multiplier can never be carried from ball to ball. There is no mid-ball bonus collect.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>In competition/novelty play, specials score 100,000 points, and extra balls would be disabled (they cannot have a point value). In arcade play, the special can instead give an extra ball, a free game, or both of those.</p>

<p>The right out lane special can be lit after making it to 3x bonus instead of 4x. Also, the special can be set to be collected repeatedly instead of once per ball.</p>

<p>The drop target special can be limited to one per ball instead of being open ended.</p>

<p>The right in lane/out lane extra ball and special can be set to alternate with each other on bumper/slingshot hits instead of it being possible for both to be lit at once.</p>
