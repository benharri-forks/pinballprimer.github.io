<h1 style="color:orangered;">Devil's Dare (Gottlieb, 1982)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Devil's Dare is all about completing target banks, but that's much easier said than done. The 3-bank of drop targets sets you up for earning bonus multipliers and gives you the ability to use the in lanes to light the spinners. The 5-banks of drop targets light the locks. Hit enough targets in multiball to give yourself a bonus, timed multiball played immediately after the current ball in play. Completing the top 4 standup targets twice lights the right out lane special, and completing the 4 right standup targets lights an extra ball at the center dogleg lane.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Upper drop targets (3-bank)</h3>

<p>Each target down scores 300 points. Completing the bank lights both of the inside in lanes for Light Spinner. Completing this bank alongside completing one or both of the 5-banks of drop targets earns 2x or 3x bonus multiplier, respectively. </p>

<h3>Upper standup targets (4-bank</h3>

<p>Each target scores 500 points. All 4 targets are off at the start of each ball. Hitting a target once starts it flashing, hitting a target a second time will light it solidly. Lighting all 4 targets in the bank lights the right out lane for a Special.</p>

<h3>Bumpers</h3>

<p>The bumpers constantly flash (rather quickly). Unlit bumpers score 1,000 points and lit bumpers score 3,000, but they flash so quickly that it's nearly impossible to intentionally get one value or the other. On 5-ball play, the bumpers score 100 or 300 when lit instead.</p>

<h3>Spinners</h3>

<p>Score 300 points per spin when not lit, or 2,000 per spin when lit. The lit green in lanes will light the opposite spinner. However, the spinner unlights if any switch othan the spinner is triggered anywhere in the game, Lit spinners can be okay value, but you only get one chance to hit each one and both are rather difficult to squarely rip.</p>

<h3>Drop target 5-banks</h3>

<p>Each target scores 300 points. Completing either bank lights the Captive Cave  (left lane) for a ball lock. Completing both banks and locking the first ball lights the Captive Pit (left spinner lane) for a lock. Locking both balls starts 3-ball multiball.</p>

<p>Completing the top 3-bank plus either 5-bank of drop targets lights 2x bonus. Completing the top 3-bank plus both 5-banks lights 3x bonus.</p>

<h3>Right side standup targets</h3>

<p>Hit unlit targets to flash them, and hit flashing targets to light them. Lit targets score 2,000 points, while unlit or flashing targets score 500. Light all 4 targets to make an Extra Ball available at the center Devil's Dare lane. On 3-ball play, the targets will always flash to start a ball, so only 1 completion is needed to light the extra ball. On 5-ball play, the targets will all start unlin, like the top standups.</p>

<h3>Captive Cave and Captive Pit</h3>

<p>A ball in either of these saucers always scores 5,000 points. If the saucers are not lit for a lock (or when the Cave is not lit for 2-Ball Multiball), the balls will just be spit out- the Cave ejects down, and the Pit ejects up underneath the green cave plastic and curving toward the bumpers. If either of these saucers are lit for a lock, the ball will stay in the saucer appropriately. Locking a ball in the Pit when it is lit, or locking a ball for 2-ball Multiball in the Cave when lit, will instantly start multiball after a new ball is plunged.</p>

<h3>Blue light standups (left side)</h3>

<p>The lower of the two targets lights the left blue in lane, and the upper target lights the right blue in lane. Going through lit blue in lanes lights a reflex shot for 2-ball multiball: the right blue in lane lights the Captive Cave lock lane, and the left blue in lane lights the Devil's Dare lane. Making the lit 2-ball Multiball shot will put the ball in the Captive Cave saucer (either directly, or via the Devil's Dare bankshot and behind the left drop targets) and 2-ball Multiball will begin when the next ball is plunged. Going through a lit blue in lane does NOT light 2-ball Multiball if a ball has already been locked in the Captive Cave toward 3-ball multiball.</p>

<h3>During multiball...</h3>

<p>There is no playfield multiplier during multiball, unlike other games of the era. However, during multiball, all drop targets and standup targets add 1,000 points times the number of balls in play to the Multi-Ball Bonus on the backglass. If the Multi-Ball Bonus does not reach 50,000, those points will be scored alongside the regular bonus at the end of the ball (but the Multi-Ball Bonus is NOT affected by the bonus multiplier). If the Multi-Ball Bonus does reach at least 50,000, though, those points become a timer for a timed multiball played by the current player immediately after the current ball in play. (On some settings, the threshold for qualifying the bonus multiball can be 50,000 for a 2-ball multiball, but 70,000 for a 3-ball multiball instead.)</p>

<p>The timed bonus multiball, called Multi-Mode by the game, subtracts 1,000 points from the timer every half second, and puts those points into the current player's score. If all balls from the multiball are drained, the remainder of the timer is immediately added to the player's score alongside the regular bonus earned during Multi-Mode. If one or more balls are still in play when the timer ends, the flippers go dead and the remaining balls are allowed to drain before the regular bonus is added. </p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Devil's Dare has a conventional in/out lane setup, but with two in lanes on each side instead of one. <br>Completing any set of drop targets, or completing the upper or right side standup targets, adds a charge to the "ball save" in the left out lane. This is a <b>manually-operated</b> kickback available to the player by using the second button on the left side of the cabinet. <br>The right out lane is lit for a special by completing the upper standup targets 2 times in a single ball.<br>All in lanes score 500 points when not lit or 3,000 when lit. The green Light Spinner When Lit in lanes are lit after completing the upper 3-bank of drop targets. The blue Light 2-Ball Multiball When Lit lanes are lit by hitting the lower left standup targets.</p>

<p>Note that the slingshots are trapezoid shaped, and the actual kicker parts are far more vertical than would be considered conventional. This can lead to prolonged visits to slingtown and slingshot -> out lane trips even if the slingshots are strong.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>I'm...at a loss here. Drop targets, standup targets, and spins of the spinner all increase the bonus, which is displayed on the backglass. The thing is, as far as I can tell, how much bonus each thing gives is random. Drop targets and standup targets seem to give anywhere from 100 to 600 bonus, while spins seem to give anywhere from 200 to 900 bonus, all in multiples of 100. If you, the reader, know about the rhyme or reason for how much bonus each target gives when, please let me know.<br>Bonus multiplier is given for completing the 3-bank of drop targets and one (for 2x bonus) or both (for 3x bonus) of the 5-banks of drop targets.</p>

<p>See the "During multiball..." section above for an explanation of the Multi-Ball Bonus.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>In tournament/novelty settings, specials and extra balls both score 50,000 points.</p>

<p>On 5 ball play, the right side standup targets require 2 completions instead of 1 to light the extra ball and award a charge of the kickback, and the bumpers score 100/300 when lit instead of 1,000/3,000 when lit.</p>
