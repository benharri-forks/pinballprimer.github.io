<h1 style="color:navy;">Space Station (Williams, 1987)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>If green locks (or "docks") are not lit, finish 1-2-3 at the upper playfield to light them. The upper right lane can pop a ball back to the upper playfield. Once locks are lit, lock two balls at the left orbit or right ramp, then lock a third at the left orbit or upper right lane. During multiball, re-lock 2 balls to score the jackpot.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>1-2-3 lanes (upper playfield)</h3>

<p>Going through a lane scores 2,000 points and lights that lane. Completing 1-2-3 scores 25,000 points and increases the bumper value by 500 points for the rest of the game, up to a maximum of 3,000. Completing 1-2-3 also lights the locks when they are not already lit.</p>

<p>The ball will always be served here at the beginning of the ball, and the ball will always be sent here by hitting the upper right saucer. 1-2-3 lights can be moved via lane change; either flipper can be used, but both flippers move the lane change in the same direction. If 2 balls are locked or multiball is running, don't complete these lanes right away; leave one unlit so that after multiball only one shot is required to light the locks again. <br>Lit 1-2-3 lanes are retained from ball to ball.</p>

<h3>U-S-A lanes (playfield level, below the 1-2-3 lanes)</h3>

<p>Each lanes scores 2,000 points and lights that lane. Completing U-S-A scores 25,000 points, lights the left orbit saucer for 100,000 points, and advances the Stop n Score multiplier (explained later) up to a maximum of 5X. Completing U-S-A three times in one ball lights a special at the lower right solo standup target. U-S-A lane lights can also be moved via lane change in the same way as the 1-2-3 lights.</p>

<h3>Left orbit and saucer</h3>

<p>Scores 5,000 points if Dock or Release is not lit, or 20,000 points if one of those is lit. Can also be lit to score an additional 100,000 points once by completing U-S-A. </p>

<p>If Dock is lit, the ball will be fired into one of the locks on the sides of the playfield, as chosen by the little Space Station diverter toy. If Release is lit, shooting this saucer starts multiball. If neither is lit, the ball will look like it's being sent to the left lock, but then be fired back into the playfield off the S-T-A standup targets.</p>

<h3>Right saucer</h3>

<p>Always scores 20,000 points. Sends the ball back into the upper playfield for another chance at a 1-2-3 light, unless two balls are locked, in which case it will be lit for Release and shooting this saucer will start multiball.</p>

<h3>Drop targets (upper right, on the way to the back right saucer)</h3>

<p>Each target down scores 1,000 points. Completing the bank scores 50,000 points and advances the bonus multiplier. Advancing the bonus multiplier to 4X (three completions) will light extra ball at these drop targets, and completing the bank on more time (to reach 5X bonus) scores that extra ball. Maximum bonus multiplier is 7X; bonus multiplier is not carried from ball to ball.</p>

<h3>SHUTTLE targets, STATION targets, and lower right solo standup</h3>

<p>Shuttle targets are positioned in a single bank of 7 on the left side of the playfield. Station targets are split into a bank of 3 and a bank of 4; the former is left of center in the middle of the playfield, while the latter are on the right side of the playfield above the ramp shot.</p>

<p>Targets with flashing letters score 20,000 points and turn the letter solid. Solid letter targets score 10,000 points. Completing Shuttle or Station gives the corresponding lit award on the center of the playfield: the options are</p>
<ul>
	<li>Special</li>
	<li>Extra Ball</li>
	<li>50,000 points plus light outlanes</li>
	<li>50,000 points plus award Bonus Ball</li>
	<li>150,000 points plus hold bonus</li>
	<li>75,000 points</li>
	<li>25,000 points</li>
</ul>
<p>Hitting the solo standup target on the right side of the playfield below the ramp will randomize one of the awards. The lights in front of this target tell you whether hitting it will change the Shuttle or Station award; hitting both flippers at once will cause it to switch which award is lit. Use this to "lock in" an award you like on one of the words and re-roll the other one until it is something appealing.<br>If special is lit by completing U-S-A three times, it will also be collected at this solo target.</p>

<h3>Right ramp and Stop & Score</h3>

<p>There is a drop target in front of the right ramp. Knocking it down will begin Stop n Score, a timed mode where the ramp can be hit once for a variable score. For the next 25 seconds, the score displays other than the one used by the current player will start at 20,000, quickly count up to 99,990, then reset back to 20,000. The ramp then scores whatever value is on the display when the ball reaches the top. This value is then multiplied by the Stop n Score multiplier, which was advanced by the number of times U-S-A has been completed on that ball, up to a maximum of 5X. <br>Every Space Station is different, but typically, if the ball is trapped on the left flipper, lower the flipper when 65,000 is showing on the Stop & Score and then immediately make the ramp to cash in close to maximum value.</p>

<p>After Stop & Score is collected, or if it times out, the drop target in front of the ramp will reset- <i>unless</i> docks are lit. This right ramp can also be used to lock the first two balls toward multiball! Hitting the drop target as soon as locks are lit means it will stay down until two balls are locked.</p>

<h3>Multiball</h3>

<p>Once docks are lit by completing the 1-2-3 lanes, lock two balls at the left orbit or right ramp, then lock a third ball at the left orbit or upper right lane. (Docks will be on by default at the beginning of the game.) The 3 balls will be kicked out, the entire playfield will be lit green, and you will be told that you must redock. To do so, lock two balls again- either at the left orbit or right ramp- before returning to single ball play. Doing so awards the Rescue Jackpot, which is worth a minimum of 200,000 points; its value increases by 10,000 points every time a multiball occurs without a jackpot collection, and the value can build up across multiple games. The objective is easy enough that it will usually never get too high, though. </p>

<p>This game <i>does</i> have lock stealing! If 2 balls are locked, regardless of whether you are the one who just put them there or not, make it a priority to start multiball right away, even if you're the type of person that prefers to play for Stop & Score instead. </p>

<h3>Bonus ball</h3>

<p>Bonus Ball is one of the awards that can be given by a Shuttle or Station completion. This is different from a conventional extra ball. After all players have played their standard three balls (and any corresponding extra balls), Bonus Balls will be played in turn by anyone who received one. This is a timed 4th ball that lasts 25 seconds if the player who earned it did not play a multiball at any point in their game, or 45 seconds if they did. Multiball cannot be started during Bonus Ball, so the most efficient way to score during this time is probably Stop & Score. I am not sure what happens if an extra ball is lit or scored during the Bonus Ball.<br>As soon as the Bonus Ball time runs out, the game will lock the flippers and start the bonus countdown; nothing that the ball hits as it eventually drains will count toward scoring. If the ball drains while there is still Bonus Ball time left, the ball will return to the plunger lane and the timer will continue.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the playfield</h3>

<p>There are no in lanes at all, with the slingshots connecting right to the base of each flipper like a machine from the late 60s. This means ball control can be difficult and on the fly play is rewarded. The best way to get a ball under control is with dead bouncing and nudging. Forget about flipper transfers: if the ball is on a flipper that you don't like, just try to smack it into the left orbit, back right saucer, or right ramp.</p>

<p>Both out lanes are lit at the start of each ball. The left out lane has a kickback that will poke a ball back into play. After being used, it turns itself off, but not for a few seconds, so if a ball ends up in the out lane multiple times back to back or if multiple balls end up in the out lane in quick succession, the kickback can give you two for the price of one. <br>The right out lane is worth 100,000 points when lit, and collecting the 100,000 will cause it to immediately unlight. There is no kickback or gate to save a right out lane drain.<br>Both out lanes are worth 10,000 points when unlit and can only be relit by the "50,000 + Light Outlanes" Shuttle/Station award.</p>

<h3>Miscellanea</h3>

<p>Bonus starts at 1,000 points. I believe actions that advance it by 1,000 points each include the multiplier drop targets, Shuttle and Station targets, U-S-A lanes, and possibly 1-2-3 lanes. Bonus really isn't worth that much in the grand scheme of the game unless the game is set such that bonus multiplier is carried over from ball to ball, which is NOT the case by default.</p>

<p>Lighting Hold Bonus carries over the base bonus value, but not the multiplier, unless that setting is changed as described above.</p>

<p>By default, progress toward Shuttle, Station, U-S-A, and 1-2-3 is carried from ball to ball, as is the bumper value, but Stop n Score multiplier is reset after each ball. However, each item listed has its own setting that can be changed.</p>
