<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>If the right flipper is strong enough to make the left orbit and the return isn't an awful center drain, that should be the only thing you bother shooting over the course of the game. If the orbit is unviable, complete each drop target bank once to light the game's 3 spinners for 2,000 a spin, then shoot whichever one is convenient with the goal of ending up in the top lanes for carryover bonus multiplier.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>Whether lit or unlit, top lanes score 1,000 points. Roll through an unlit lane to light it. Lit lanes can be rotated with right flipper lane change only. Lighting all 3 lanes increases the bonus multiplier toward the maximum of 10x. The plunge and all 3 spinners should put the ball in the top lanes area. By default, there is a one way gate to the right of the Z (rightmost) lane, but this may be removed to make bonus multipliers harder to earn.</p>

<h3>Drop targets</h3>

<p>Bank 1 is on the left, bank 2 is in the center, and bank 3 is on the right. Each target down in any bank scores 2,000 points and advances that number bonus (1, 2, 3) by 1,000 points up to a maximum of 7,000. Completing bank lights spinners; bank 1 lights the left spinner, bank 2 lights the lower right spinner, and bank 3 lights the upper right spinner. Once lit, spinners stay lit for the rest of the ball. Spinners score 2,000 points per spin when lit, but only 10 per spin when not lit.</p>

<p>Completing bank 1, 2, or 3 lights the corresponding number in front of the gate in the middle-right that sends a ball back to the shooter lane. Going through this lane when some, but not all, of 1-2-3 are lit will score 10,000 points per lit number and keep the numbers on. Going through this lane when all three of 1-2-3 are lit will score the 30,000 points for the lit numbers, plus a full collect of the entire bonus including multiplier. This bonus collect does not reset the base bonus or multiplier, but it does turn off the 1-2-3 lights in front of the gate, so you need to complete banks again to qualify the collect bonus another time.</p>

<p>If all three bonus counts are at the same nonzero value, an extra ball will be lit. This can be in one of 4 places: the center drop target of each of the three banks, or the 7,000-point standup target above-left of the bumpers. The location of the lit extra ball will change on its own every few seconds, and it will also rotate with each slingshot hit or each spin of the left spinner. </p>

<p>If all three bonuses are maxed out at 7,000 points, a special will be lit in similar manner to the extra balls: it is collectible at the center target of one of the drop banks, rotating with time, slingshot hits, or spins of the upper right spinner. Also, maxing all three bonuses lights Double Score, which means any further drop targets hit that ball score 14,000 points each.</p>

<p>When lit, the in lanes or the standup target near the bumpers will spot a target in bank 3. Which of these three is lit for spot target changes with slingshot hits.</p>

<h3>Orbit shot</h3>

<p>A full shot to the left orbit that comes down the lane with the upper right spinner scores an Orbit Shot. Orbit Shot scores and advances the lit value: 20,000 - 40,000 - 70,000 - extra ball - 70,000 - special, then a repeated 70,000. You'll also get credit for both the left and upper right spinners, which can be very big value if both are lit for 2,000 per spin. If the Orbit Shot can be reliably made, it's reasonable to make it the only focus in the game, with a possible exception of lighting the two spinners on either end first.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Warlok has a conventional in/out lane setup. Out lanes score 15,000 points, and can be lit alternately for special once the bonus multiplier reaches at least 7x. In lanes score 7,000 points, and are lit in rotation to spot a target in bank 3.</p>

<p>There is a center peg between the flippers.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Each of the three bonuses are advanced by hitting a drop target in the respective numbered bank. Max bonus is 7,000 in each bank. Bonus multiplier is advanced by completing the top lanes, incremented 1 at a time up to a maximum of 10x. Bonus multiplier is carried from ball to ball, but base bonus is not. Bonus can be collected mid ball by completing all 3 drop target banks then shooting the gate back to the shooter lane on the right. Max bonus is 10x 3x 7,000 = 210,000 points.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>Specials score 50,000 points in competition/novelty play. Extra balls cannot be set to a point value.</p>

<p>Orbit shots and bonus multipliers can have their ball to ball memory removed.</p>

<p>Out lane specials can be lit at 7x, 8x, 9x, or 10x.</p>
