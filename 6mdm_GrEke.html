<h1 style="text-align:center">The Six Million Dollar Man (Bally, 1978)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Complete the right drop targets once to light the spinners for 1,000 a spin, then shoot to the top of the table through either spinner to build bonus and land on the saucer for bonus multipliers. Once bonus is maxed out, go for completions of 50,000 by making the two top lanes and the three left targets.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top saucer</h3>

<p>Should be the target of any plunge or spinner shot until it has been hit 5 times. Each hit scores 3,000 - 5,000 - 2X bonus - 3X bonus - 5X bonus. Once 5X bonus has been achieved, subsequent saucer hits score 10,000 points, and the out lanes will light alternately for a special. Also, any saucer hit raises the center post and awards 3 bonus advance in a 3-ball game, or 1 bonus advance in a 5-ball game.</p>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>The left lane awards the 5, and the right lane awards the first 0, toward the 50,000 bonus. Each lane also scores 500 points and one bonus advance. </p>

<h3>Spinners (both sides)</h3>

<p>Score 10 points per spin, or 1,000 per spin when lit. Bonus is advanced with every 5th spin of either spinner. Both spinners are lit after completing the right side drop targets once. Lit spinners are the safest way to get decent points on this table. </p>

<h3>Center target</h3>

<p>Scores 500 points and raises the center post between the flippers.</p>

<h3>Right side drop targets</h3>

<p>Each target down scores 30 points. Completing the bank scores 3,000 points. The first completion of the bank lights both spinners; the second awards an extra ball; the third and each one thereafter scores a special. Unless extra balls are on, ignore these targets after clearing them once.</p>

<h3>Left side zero targets and the 50,000 power score</h3>

<p>Each target scores 500 points, 1 bonus advance, and collects the corresponding zero. Spelling 50,000 by hitting these three targets as well as both top lanes scores the Bionic Power Bonus of 50,000 points, 5 bonus advances, raises the center post, and opens the right out lane gate. Collecting the 50,000 bonus three times on a single ball scores a special.</p>

<h3>Star rollovers</h3>

<p>Score 10 points and lower the center post if it is raised.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is advanced by any of the 50,000 lanes or targets, as well as every 5th spin of either spinner. Bonus is also advanced once on 5-ball play or 3 times on 3-ball play at the top saucer. Base bonus maxes out at 20,000 points in 5-ball play and 29,000 points in 3-ball play. Bonus multipliers of 2X, 3X, or 5X can be collected by making the top saucer 3, 4, or 5 times, respectively. Bonus count and bonus multipliers cannot be carried over from ball to ball. There is no way to collect the bonus mid-ball.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>The in and out lanes are arranged in conventional fashion. Out lanes score 1,000 points, or are lit for a special alternately by collecting the 5X bonus multiplier. In lanes score 500 points and lower the center post if it is raised.</p>

<p>There is a center post between the flippers, temporarily negating the risk of a center drain as a reward. The post is raised by making the top saucer, the center target, or collecting the 50,000 power bonus. The post is lowered by both in lanes and star rollovers. </p>

<p>There is an out lane gate on the right side. It can be used once before being closed and feeds the ball back into the shooter lane for a replunge. The gate can only be opened by collecting the 50,000 power bonus.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>In competition and novelty play, both the extra ball and the special score 20,000 points.</p>

<p>A special can be awarded for completing the 50,000 bonus 2 times on a ball instead of 3.</p>

<p>The upper saucer can start each ball at the 5,000 awarded instead of 3,000, meaning the multipliers all take one less shot to the saucer.</p>

<p>The uppermost and lowermost of the three 0 targets on the left side can be tied together, so that hitting either one awards both toward the 50,000 power bonus.</p>

<p>The out lane special can be lit alternately or on both sides.</p>
