<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>On the plunge, light the spinner and open the right gate at the #2 lane. If the spinner is lit, rip it for 1,000 a spin. If the spinner is not lit, rip it anyway to send the ball back to the top and try again to get the 2 lane. Out of the top lanes, use nudging and hope to get the ball into the bonus multiplier saucer.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>1-2-3-4-5 lanes</h3>

<p>Lit at the top: from left to right, they are actually in the order 1-4-2-5-3. A lit lane means that number is not collected yet. <br>When the ball is at the top of the playfield, the 2 lane is orders of magnitude more important than the others, since it lights the spinner, opens the out lane gate, and is the only number that cannot be collected elsewhere on the table. </p>

<p>Each completion of 1-2-3-4-5 awards 25,000 points and does something different on the table. The first time through, numbers light the center star rollovers for advance bonus; the second time, the left jet stream lane rollovers are lit for advance bonus; on the 3rd completion, the top lanes are lit for 3,000 each and the drop targets are lit for 3,000 per completion; the 4th completion and on lights all the rollovers (center and left) for 1,000 points instead of 100 and awards an extra ball (worth 25,000 points if EBs are off).</p>

<p>The 1 can be collected from the center standup target, and 3-4-5 can be collected at the right side standups. On some settings, the 1 and 3 are linked, so collecting one scores both; 4 and 5 can be linked in the same manner. Regardless, 2, can only be awarded form the center top lane.</p>

<p>It can be helpful to get the 3 and 5 numbers as well if attempting a spinner strategy (which is objectively the best strategy), since the 3 and 5 center rollovers are on the way to the spinner, so bonus can be advanced alongside the spinner being shot.</p>

<h3>Upper right saucer</h3>

<p>Advances the bonus multiplier to 2X, 3X, or 5X (there is no 4X in this game). Max bonus is 5x 29,000, or 145,000. This can be decent points, but any shot that could be aimed at the saucer really needs to go through the spinner instead, so stick to bounces out of the pops to collect multipliers.</p>

<h3>Spinner</h3>

<p>Know it. Live it. Love it. Want it. Have it.</p>

<p>Unlit spinner is worth 100 points a spin, lit spinner is worth 1,000. Spinner is lit by going through the #2 lane at the top of the playfield, and can be unlit by using up the right return gate. This is the only source of points in the game that is not extremely wood-choppy. If spinner is lit, shoot it very hard. If it's not lit, shoot it anyway, since through the spinner is the best way to get to the top of the playfield to try for the 2 lane again. <br>It's entirely viable to shoot nothing but this spinner. Find a way to pass the ball from right to left if the ball is trapped on the right, then find and nail the spinner shot from the left. Even if the spinner doesn't spin super well or quickly, this is probably still the most efficient path to points in the game.</p>

<h3>Drop targets</h3>

<p>Worth 500 points each (I think?). Completing the drops twice in ball scores extra ball (or 25,000 points). The third completion and on scores special (or 50,000 points). Completing 1-2-3-4-5 three whole times lights this bank for a paltry 3,000 point completion bonus. There can be decent points here, but shots to the drop targets put the ball farther out of control than shots to the spinner, so just stick to lit spinner.</p>

<h3>Left jet stream lane</h3>

<p>Largely irrelevant. Most of the time the rollovers give 100 points each and nothing else. As 1-2-3-4-5 are cleared for the second time, they will light for advance bonus, and the value will increase to 1,000 each after four (!) completions of 1-2-3-4-5. When playing for spinner shots, base bonus will probably be maxed before these are light for bonus advance anyway, and being lit for 1,000 is a downright insulting award for 4 completions of the numbers. Use the ball ending up over here as an opportunity to control the return, but don't intentionally shoot over here ever.</p>

<h3>Right gate</h3>

<p>Lit by going through the 2 lane. The gate opens to the right, meaning that a ball in right out lane will be sent to the shooter lane, not the in lane. Using the gate unlights the gate and the spinner, so be sure that the resulting plunge tries to put the ball in the 2 lane again.</p>
