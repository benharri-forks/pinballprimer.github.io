<h1>No Fear: Dangerous Sports (Bally Williams, 1995)</h1>



<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Beginner and intermediate players should focus on getting points from the Jump ramp (left ramp -> side ramp repeatedly), multiball (locks are at Skull or Skydive lane; three locks starts multiball; jackpots are skull -> Skydive -> Jump ramp), and Payback Time (three shots to each ramp; all major shots lit for 25,000,000 points for 20 seconds).<br>Advanced players should work toward the Major modes, which are available after playing all five Minor modes; modes are started at the Skull when no multiball or other mode is running. Payback Time and loops of the Jump ramp are of course still valuable as well.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Skill shot</h3>

<p>The skill shot consists of pressing the launch button and receiving an award. The award will automatically change every few seconds, or can be manually rotated with a flipper button. Possible awards include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Start Challenge: automatically start the flashing mode. This can only be used to start one of the five Minor modes, and will not be available if lock #3 is lit for multiball.</li>
	<li>Supercross level: scores 15,000,000 points and gives credit for one shot to each ramp (left and right) toward Payback Time. This <i>can</i> be used to start Payback Time directly if both ramps already have credit for 2 shots.</li>
	<li>Advance Raceway: spots one Raceway award from the left orbit toward extra ball.</li>
	<li>Lock Ball: a free lock toward multiball. You cannot use this to lock ball 3 for a free multiball start.</li>
	<li>Flipper Skill Shot: the ball will be diverted to the lower left flipper. You must shoot the left ramp followed immediately by the Jump ramp for a 50,000,000 point skill shot.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Modes</h3>

<p>There are a total of 8 main modes in No Fear. They are subdivided into 5 minor challenges that can be played in any order, followed by 2 major challenges that have a set order, followed by Meet Your Maker wizard mode. The 5 minor modes and the first major mode (No Limits) can be started at the Skull at any time as long as there is not a mode or multiball running. The second major mode (Fear Fest) and Meet Your Maker require making a total of 6 of any major shot to spell No Fear before the Skull will be lit to start the mode. If a multiball is started while a mode is running, the mode will pause until the multiball ends.</p>

<p><b>Minor challenges (can be played in any order, slingshots rotate which mode will be started):</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Dirt Challenge:</i> 30-second mode. The left and right ramps start at a value of 5,000,000 points. Any shot, including the ramps, increases the ramp value by 5,000,000 points up to a maximum of 20,000,000, but only the ramps score the ramp value. The Jump ramp has its usual scoring, starting at 5,000,000 each time the left ramp is made and increasing to a maximum of 25,000,000 per shot if 5 consecutive Jump ramps are made on the same trip to the skyloop.</li>
	<li><i>Asphalt Challenge:</i> 30-second mode. Shoot the Skull, or the Track loop that runs to the immediate side of the Skull, 3 times. Scoring: 50,000,000 - 75,000,000 - 100,000,000.</li>
	<li><i>Water Challenge:</i> mode timer starts at 20 seconds. All shots start at a value of 10,000,000 points. The far left saucer will add 10 seconds to the timer (cannot go above 30) and 5,000,000 points to the value of all shots. The left saucer will no longer add any time or shot value once all shots are worth 30,000,000 points.</li>
	<li><i>Snow Challenge:</i> 30-second mode. Shoot the right ramp one time to score 50,000,000 points and end the mode. The right orbit and Jump ramp add 10,000,000 points to the right ramp's value, maxing out at 100,000,000. You cannot chain Jump ramp shots on the skyloop in this mode; after making one, the ball will be diverted to the left in lane to assist with a right ramp shot.</li>
	<li><i>Air Challenge:</i> a hurry-up starts at 25,000,000 points and counts down to 10,000,000 over about 15 seconds. Shooting the Skydive lane just the right of the left ramp will lock in the hurry-up value. Once the hurry-up is locked, in the main part of the mode begins: you have 30 seconds to hit every major shot on the playfield, and each shot scores the locked-in hurry-up value (or 10,000,000 points if the hurry-up went unclaimed). If you succeed at hitting every shot within the time limit, a 75,000,000 completion bonus is awarded.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Major challenges: will always be played in the order listed below, and only after all 5 minor challenges have been played</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><i>No Limits:</i> 3-ball multiball with a generous ball save (20 seconds or so). The starting shot value is 20,000,000 points. Making any shot in the game scores the shot value and increases the shot value by 1,000,000, up to a maximum of 70,000,000 per shot. This continues for as long as more than one ball is in play.</li>
	<li><i>Fear Fest:</i> 3-ball multiball with a very generous ball save (30 seconds or so). The Skull and Skydive are lit for a jackpot that starts at 70,000,000 points and increases by 20,000,000 each time any shot in the game other than the Skull or Skydive is hit. Once a jackpot is collected, 4 non-Skull and non-Skydive shots are required to relight the jackpot. Jackpots after the first will start at 100,000,000 points, still being able to be raised by 20,000,000 each time. This process repeats until single ball play resumes.<li>
	<li><i><u>Meet Your Maker wizard mode:</u></i> a 4-ball multiball with 20 seconds of ball save. This is a relatively standard Everything Is Lit wizard mode. The Skull is lit for extra ball and a repeatable 50,000,000 point jackpot. The Jump ramp is constantly lit for a repeatable 200,000,000 points, so getting a ball to the skyloop and comboing the Jump ramp can be worth billions of points. Super Spinner is lit at the left orbit for 1,000,000 points per spin. All other switches in the game score 250,000 points. Payback Time is not started right away, but you do get credit for two of each ramp, so all it takes is one left ramp and one right ramp to start Payback Time and add 25,000,000 points to every shots value for 20 seconds. Finally, Kickback is lit, and the Raceway value is maxed at 20,000,000 points. The best way to play this mode is to trap one or more balls on the left flipper, then use the right flipper to shoot the left ramp and keep a Jump ramp combo going for as long as you can. There is no way to complete Meet Your Maker; like any other multiball, it ends when there is just one ball left in play.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both the rules of the major challenges and the fact that they are all multiballs rather than timed single ball modes mean that major challenges are far more valuable than minor challenges. Many players will opt to start minor challenges, but then keep the ball held on the flipper allowing time to run out as much as possible with the goal of making it to the major modes with minimal shots and fewer opportunities for the ball to drain. The game tries to defend against this somewhat, pausing the timer on any timed modes if no switches are hit anywhere in the game after about 5-7 seconds.</p>

<p>Minor and major challenge modes cannot be replayed until Meet Your Maker ends, at which point all challenge progress is reset for another trip through the game.</p>

<h3>Locks and multiball</h3>

<p>Locks are lit at the Skydive lane just to the right of the left ramp and the Skull. If locks are not lit, you must hit a drop target in the Skydive lane to light locks. Locking three balls starts multiball. Multiball is a 3-ball affair. Jackpots are lit one at a time in the following sequence: 50,000,000 points at the Skull, then 100,000,000 at the Skydive lane, then 200,000,000 at the Jump ramp, and repeat. Play through this sequence as many times as possible during the multiball. The left saucer will hold onto a ball for about 15 seconds, letting you continue to play multiball rules with one less ball in the way.<br>If multiball ends without a single jackpot collected, Last Chance will begin, wherein all three jackpots will be lit for 15 seconds of single ball play. There is no restart to the multiball, even if you collect a jackpot during the Last Chance time.</p>

<p>Multiball can be started during a minor challenge mode; this will pause the mode until the multiball ends. Multiball cannot be started during a major challenge mode.</p>

<h3>Payback Time</h3>

<p>Shooting the left and right ramps three times each starts Payback Time. Only the ramps with a flashing orange circle in front of them advance toward Payback Time, which requires you to shoot them evenly and alternate between the two. As soon as the last ramp shot registers, Payback Time starts; every shot in the game is worth 25,000,000 points for 20 seconds. Payback Time can run on top of any mode or any multiball, and it's recommended to try to get Payback Time to be one ramp away from starting before beginning multiball or a major challenge mode. </p>

<h3>Steering Wheel awards</h3>

<p>In single ball play when Asphalt Challenge minor mode is not running, the Track shot loops around the Skull will advance Steering Wheels. The first Steering Wheel moves you into third place and scores 15,000,000 points. The second Wheel brings you to second place and scores 25,000,000. The third wheel gives a Track Award:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The 1st, 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th awards light the in lanes for hurry-ups, which are worth up to 50,000,000 points and are collected at the orbit opposite of the lit in lane that was made.</li>
	<li>The 2nd Track Award lights extra ball at the Skull. </li>
	<li>The 3rd Track Award is Over the Edge, a 2-ball quick multiball where the right ramp and Jump score 25,000,000 points increasing by 10,000,000 each time up to a max of 75,000,000. The Jump ramp sends the ball back to the left flipper, so you can't loop the Jump ramp for massive points, limiting just how good this multiball can be.</li>
	<li>All other Track Awards not listed above between the 4th and 19th score 20,000,000 points, plus an additional 10,000,000 for each time Light In Lanes has been awarded.</li>
	<li>The <i>20th</i> Track Award is 100,000,000 points, and no further Track Awards can be earned.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Raceway award</h3>

<p>The right in lane or a shot to the unlit left orbit will light the left orbit. The left orbit scores a Raceway when lit. Five Raceways score 5,000,000, then 10,000,000, then 15,000,000, then 20,000,000, then light extra ball. Once the extra ball has been lit from Raceways, no further Raceways can be scored that ball. Progress on Raceways is carried over from ball to ball until the first extra ball is lit; after that it will reset to 5,000,000 points at the start of each ball. For the second extra ball, it takes 2 lit left orbit shots to advance the Raceway value one level. I do not know if getting a third or more extra ball would require 3 or more shots per level.</p>

<h3>Climber targets and Jump This!</h3>

<p>There are two standup targets in the lower right of the table. Hitting both targets relights the kickback in the left out lane if it is not already lit. Any 2 shots to either target will earn 100 meters climbed. Reaching the top of a mountain by climbing enough meters will light the out lanes for Jump This!. The first mountain requires climbing 400 meters, the second requires an additional 900, the third requires an additional 1,400, etc., but no mountain will ever require more than 4,000 meters. Completing any mountain scores 30,000,000 points. If the ball drains down an out lane lit for Jump This!, it will be returned to the playfield, with a special mode where all Jump ramp shots score 30,000,000 points for the next 30 seconds. You can also get the 30,000,000 by making two consecutive left ramp shots with no switches in between other than the right in lane. Normal gameplay resumes when the timer expires; Jump This! is a proper drain shield, and the game won't lock the flippers like other last chance modes. Only one out lane can be lit for Jump This! at any time, and it will alternate with slingshot hits.</p>

<h3>Summit awards</h3>

<p>A hidden feature with similar rules to Raceway is available for consecutive shots to the right orbit, which score 5,000,000 points, then Light Video Mode, then Super Spinner, then a repeatable 10,000,000 points for the first four consecutive right orbits on each ball.</p>

<h3>Left saucer "Tube" shot: mystery award</h3>

<p>When no mode or multiball is running, the saucer at the end of the far left Tube lane awards one of the following randomly:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Points: 20,000,000</li>
	<li>200 meters for the Climber</li>
	<li>Light Lock</li>
	<li>Award Lock: usually if Lock was already lit when you entered the mystery saucer</li>
	<li>Light Kickback</li>
	<li>Light Return Lanes (in lanes)</li>
	<li>Start Multiball: usually only if Lock 3 was already lit</li>
	<li>Start Challenge: usually only if the Skull was already lit for Start Challenge</li>
	<li>Start Hurry-up</li>
	<li>Over the Edge multiball: see Steering Wheel awards</li>
	<li>Advance Raceway</li>
	<li>Autofire: 30 seconds of ball save</li>
	<li>Light Extra Ball</li>
	<li>Video Mode</li>
	<li>Perhaps others?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Video Mode</h3>

<p>Video Mode is started at the left saucer and can be lit by making 3 consecutive right orbit shots or as a Mystery award outcome. Use the left and right flippers to move a biker. Look ahead to see if future hills have numbers above them when the biker jumps off a hill ramp; riding into a number scores that many millions of points. There's also a 25,000,000 award for getting to the end. A single video mode is usually worth 80-150 million points.</p>

<h3>More on the Jump ramp</h3>

<p>Pretty much any time the left ramp is shot, you will want to try to combo it into as many consecutive loops of the Jump ramp shot as possible with the upper right flipper. Most of the time, the first Jump ramp shot scores 5,000,000 points, and subsequent loops each score 5,000,000 more than the previous one, up to a max of 25,000,000 each for 5th loop and beyond. The sequence breaks whenever the ball returns to the playfield from the Jump ramp skyloop area. Jump ramp shots always score 25,000,000 points during any multiball, unless the Jump ramp is lit for a 200,000,000 point super jackpot during regular multiball instead. Finally, each successful Jump ramp made over the course of the game is worth 5,000,000 points for the end of ball bonus, with no limit that I have ever encountered.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>No Fear has a conventional in/out lane setup. Out lanes can be lit for Jump This! by the lower right standup targets, alternately with slingshot hits. There is a kickback in the left out lane, which is on at the start of the game and can be relit once used by the lower right standup targets yet again. When lit, the in lanes will start a hurry-up worth up to 50,000,000 points on the orbit opposite of the lit in lane that was scored. In lanes are lit by various Steering Wheel awards, or by the mystery. <br>There is a center peg between the flippers to defend against center drains, which are relatively common if a ball rolls back down the left or right ramp, comes down the left side of the Track loop, or bounces off a post from a missed Skull shot.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is calculated as 10,000,000 points per challenge mode started (minor, major, and wizard modes all count), plus 5,000,000 per jump ramp, plus 10,000 points per Climber meter collected (which are always collected 100 at a time). There is no bonus multiplier. All three of these counts are taken as number earned across the entire game, so bonus is effectively held from ball to ball. There is no mid-ball bonus collect.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>There is no way to earn a Special in No Fear, and extra balls cannot be set to have a point value in competition/novelty play.</p>

<p>The kickback can be set to relight via any two shots to the lower right standup targets rather than requiring one of each.</p>

<p>The Raceway value can be told to reset after every ball even if the first Raceway extra ball has not been lit.</p>

<p>The first Cliff award can be at anywhere from 200 to 1,000 meters. Subsequent Cliff awards will always require 500 more meters than the previous and can never exceed 4,000 meters.</p>

<p>The game can be set to clear Payback Time progress between balls for players who have played Payback Time at least once already. By default it does not do this, always keeping Payback Time progress in memory.</p>
