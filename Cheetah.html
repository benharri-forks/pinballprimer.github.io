<h1 style="color:yellow;">Cheetah (Stern Electronics, 1980)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Use the middle-right 3-bank of drop targets to increase both base bonus (per target down) and bonus multiplier (for each completion starting with the 2nd). Then, complete sets of 1-2-3-4-5 by either hitting drop targets in order or spotting numbers from around the playfield into the left orbit is lit for Collect Bonus. Once it is, shoot for that all day long. Extra balls and specials, which can both be set to 100,000 points for competition/novelty play, are lit by 3 completions of the side targets, 4 completions of 1-2-3-4-5, or making a line of red or orange lights at the upper right drop targets.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top drop target 3-bank</h3>

<p>Each target down scores 500 points. If the bonus multiplier is still 1x and this bank is not set to have 2x lit by default, the first completion of this bank scores 5,000 points. Otherwise, completing this bank increments the bonus multiplier up to a maximum of 5x and scores 5,000 points times whatever the bonus multiplier was just increased to.</p>

<h3>Upper right star targets</h3>

<p>Each target down scores 2,000 points. In front of each target is a rotating light that cycles between red, blue, yellow, and orange. Knocking down a target locks in the rotating colour. If, when the bank is completed, there are 2 targets set to the same colour, that bank completion is worth 20,000 points. If all 3 targets are on the same colour when the bank is completed, the bank completion scores 40,000 points, and the following other scoring features are qualified depending on which line was made:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Red: the kicker lane in the middle right is lit for a special.</li>
	<li>Yellow: the upper right spinner is lit for 3,000 points a spin.</li>
	<li>Blue: the left spinner, hit by making a shot from the right flipper that travels in front of the upper left flipper, is lit for 3,000 points a spin.</li>
	<li>Orange: the horseshoe lane immediately behind these targets is lit for an extra ball.</li>
</ul>
<p>The spinner in the horseshoe lane behind these targets always scores 3,000 points per spin.</p>

<h3>1-2-3-4-5 number sets, and the 5-bank of drop targets</h3>

<p>Hit the drop target corresponding to the lit number to collect it. Numbers can also be spotted by the left orbit (behind the upper left flipper), the kickback lane on the right, or the near in lanes. Completing sets of 1-2-3-4-5 awards the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>1st time: 10,000 points</li>
	<li>2nd time: 20,000 points and lights the left orbit for Collect Bonus</li>
	<li>3rd time: 30,000 points and instantly max out the base bonus count at 100,000 points</li>
	<li>4th time: 40,000 points and light the near in lanes for an extra ball</li>
	<li>5th time: 50,000 points and light the out lanes for a special</li>
</ul>

<h3>Right side kickback lane</h3>

<p>Scores 25,000 points and spots the next lit number toward 1-2-3-4-5. If the three red stars have been lined up at the upper right drop targets, this lane is lit for a special. It can't be shot directly; the ball just falls in here sometimes, typically out of a ricochet from the pop bumpers or the 1-2-3-4-5 targets. A ball ending up here will be kicked back into play, usually directly at the #5 drop target.</p>

<h3>Middle-right drop target 3-bank</h3>

<p>Each target down scores 1,000 points and a bonus advance. The first completion of this bank does not come with any awards. The second completion scores 15,000 points and advances the bonus multiplier. The third completion scores 40,000 points, advances the bonus multiplier, and lights the standup target near the pop bumpers for an extra ball. Further completions after the third score 40,000 points and the multiplier advance, but cannot light additional extra balls on that ball in play.<br>This bank of targets is the safest way to increase both base bonus count and bonus multiplier, which is good, because ideally, you'll be collecting the bonus over and over again.</p>

<h3>Left orbit shot</h3>

<p>The lone switch in this orbit scores 10,000 points and spots the currently lit number from 1-2-3-4-5. If the set of 1-2-3-4-5 has been completed twice, this lane is lit for the rest of the game for Collect Bonus. It will score the entire bonus, including multiplier, and not reset the base bonus or the multiplier when it's done! If you've been able to max out the bonus, this orbit could be worth as much as 500,000 per shot, but as soon as your bonus times multiplier is more than 100,000, this becomes the best scoring option in the game. </p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Cheetah has a conventional in/out lane setup, but with two in lanes on each side instead of one, thanks to its widebody layout.</p>

<p>The out lanes score 25,000 points and 3 bonus advances. They can also be lit for a special by completing 1-2-3-4-5 in order five times.<br>The far in lanes score 5,000 points and one bonus advance.<br>The near in lanes score 10,000 points and spot the next number in 1-2-3-4-5; they are lit for an extra ball after 4 completions of 1-2-3-4-5.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is advanced 1 time by the far in lanes or by each drop target in the middle-right, or 3 times by the out lanes. Note that each bonus advance is worth 10,000 points rather than the usual 1,000. Completing 1-2-3-4-5 for the third time in a game will instantly max out the base bonus at 100,000 points on that ball. Bonus multiplier is increased by completing the top left or middle right drop target banks as described above. Max bonus is 5x 100,000 = 500,000 points. Bonus can be repeatedly collected mid-ball at the left orbit after 2 completions of 1-2-3-4-5 have been made in the game so far. Base bonus can never be carried from ball to ball. Bonus multiplier does not carry over by default, but a setting is available to enable this.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>In competition/novelty play, extra balls and specials both score 100,000 points.</p>

<p>The top drop target bank can be set so that the first completion always awards 2x bonus.</p>

<p>The 1-2-3-4-5 feature can be set so that the 20,000 and Light Collect Bonus is available on the first completion, making it much easier to light the repeatable bonus collect amd advance to the higher awards.</p>

<p>The awards given by making a line of 3 coloured stars at the top right bank reset between balls by default, but can be set to stay in memory. Extra balls and specials always unlight once collected, so this is more impactful for the blue and yellow spinners (but since lit spinners are only worth 3,000 points and the normal value is 1,000, these awards are a little underwhelming anyway).</p>
