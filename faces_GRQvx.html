<h1 style="text-align:center">Faces (Sonic Segasa, 1976)</h1>

<p>Comparable layout and rules to Grand Prix (Williams, 1976).</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Shoot the spinners all day. This is general to get back up to the top of the table for safe bonus advance, but spinners are lit for 1,000 a spin after the bonus on that side of the playfield is maxed out as well. Double bonus is lit by collecting A and B from the center standup targets; only continue to shoot these if they give more than one bonus advance per hit (can be 1, 2, or 3). Faces rollovers are ignorable unless you are interested in extra balls (2 completions) or specials (4 completions).</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Red and Green Bonus</h3>

<p>There are two different end of ball bonuses: green on the left, and red on the right. Green standup targets and the left out lane advance the green bonus, while red standup targets and the right out lane advance the red bonus. The top saucer alternates between the two, or advances both bonuses if it is lit yellow. If the green bonus is maxed out, the left spinner is lit for 1,000 a spin; the same happens to the right spinner if the red bonus is maxed out. Only one bonus is selected at a time, which is always the green bonus at the start of the ball; hit the yellow standup target on the right to change which bonus is lit. Try to advance both bonuses equally so you don't drain with a small bonus selected even though the other bonus was large. </p>

<p>The two center standup targets are also lit for A and B. Hit both to light double bonus. These standup targets can also be set to award 2 or 3 bonus advances of their colour instead of just one.</p>

<h3>Faces buttons</h3>

<p>Roll over a Faces button to unlight it. Collect all 5 letters to light one of the eyes in the center of the table.</p>
<ul>
	<li>1st eye: bumpers are lit for 1,000 each, and right orbit rollover switch is lit for 5,000 points.</li>
	<li>2nd eye: extra ball is lit alternating between the two in lanes.</li>
	<li>3rd eye: extra ball is lit at both in lanes solidly for the rest of the ball.</li>
	<li>4th eye: out lanes are lit alternately for special.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gate?</h3>

<p>Anything that says "Opens Gate" will do just that, but the gate is not anywhere near the in/out lanes. Rather, the gate being open just means that the metal one-way gate at the top of the left orbit will stay completely open, allowing balls to come back down the left orbit. This is usually not desired.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Faces has a conventional in/out lane setup. In lanes score 5,000 and open the gate, and they can be lit alternately or solidly for extra ball by collecting 2 or 3 completions of Faces. Out lanes score 10,000 points and can be lit alternately for special after 4 Faces completions. The left out lane advances green bonus and the right out lane advances red bonus.</p>
