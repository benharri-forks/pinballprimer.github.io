<h1>Lucky Seven (Williams, 1978)</h1>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Start with safe points by shooting the spinner back to the top of the playfield until you've maxed the base bonus at 30,000 points. Until then, don't bother with the reel feature. The reel value is scored by knocking down both of the solo drop targets about halfway up the sides of the game. The combinations of reel symbols that give meaningful awards is one or two left clovers for double bonus, three clovers for 20,000 points and extra ball, three diamonds for 30,000, three Sevens for 30,000 and a special. Center standup targets or the 2nd/3rd/4th top lanes advance the corresponding reel one position.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>There are 4 top lanes, plus as a fifth option the ball can come down the spinner lane to the right of the top lanes. The four top lanes always give 1,000 points and a bonus advance. The second, third, and fourth lanes also each advance the respective left, center, or right slot reel one position.</p>

<h3>Reel awards</h3>

<p>The 2nd/3rd/4th top lanes and the left/center/right middle standup targets move the left/center/right slot machine reels one position, respectively. At certain combinations of symbols lined up on the reels, a Reel Value will be lit. This Reel Value is collected by shooting both of the 1,000 point drop targets about halfway up the sides of the game.</p>
<ul>
	<li>One left clover = 5,000 points and double bonus</li>
	<li>Two left clovers = 10,000 points and double bonus</li>
	<li>Three clovers = 20,000 points and extra ball, but no double bonus</li>
	<li>Three horseshoes = 20,000 points</li>
	<li>Three diamonds = 30,000 points</li>
	<li>Three Lucky Sevens = 30,000 points and a special</li>
</ul>
<p>Collecting a Reel Value resets the drop targets but does not move any of the reels, so you can collect the same value repeatedly if you can avoid changing the reels or draining the ball. If the two drop targets are knocked down when none of the above Reel Values are lit, the targets will stay down until one of the combinations is made, and then that combination is automatically scored and the targets reset. There is no additional award for collecting Double Bonus or Extra Ball multiple times during the same ball in play.</p>

<h3>Spinner</h3>

<p>Scores 10 points per spin, or 100 per spin when lit. The scoring from the spinner is utterly unremarkable, but since it's a wide shot that takes the ball back to the top of the table for more bonus advances, it's worth mastering. Rolling through either in lane lights the spinner for the rest of that ball.</p>

<h3>Standup targets</h3>

<p>The lower left standup target and upper left target near the bumpers each score 1,000 points and a bonus advance.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Lucky Seven has a conventional in/out lane setup. Out lanes score 3,000 points. In lanes score 1,000 points and a bonus advance, and light the spinner. There is no kickback, out lane gate, or center post.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is advanced by top lanes, in lanes, and the left standup targets. Notice that a single bonus advance in this game gives 3,000 points instead of the usual 1,000. Double bonus is lit by collecting the one left clover or two left clover reel values. Max bonus is 2x 30,000 = 60,000 points. There is no base bonus or bonus multipleir holdover, and there is no mid-ball bonus collect.</p>

<h3>Settings note</h3>

<p>Specials and extra balls cannot be set to have a point value for competition/novlety play.</p>
