<h1 style="color:orange;">Vulcan / Fire Queen (1977)</h1>

<p>Vulcan is the 4 player version. Fire Queen is the 2 player version. Both games have identical rules and scoring.</p>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Drop targets advance bonus. 1-5 numbers light individual white drops for 2 bonus advance and left orbit star rollovers for 1,000 each. Completing 1-5 lights specials. Green drop targets advance the value of the top right hole, and light extra ball at the #5 target after completing the bank. Late in the game, after completing the white drops once, the left orbit worth 5,000 is the way to go.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>Each lane scores 500 points and collects the corresponding number of 1-5 if it is lit. </p>

<h3>Upper right saucer</h3>

<p>Scores 1,000 points, plus 1,000 points for every green target hit. After the green targets have been completed, the saucer will still keep its max value of 5,000 points. </p>

<h3>White drop targets 5-bank</h3>

<p>Each target scores 500 points and 1 bonus advance. Each number collected in 1-2-3-4-5 lights one of the drop targets for 2 bonus advance instead of 1. Completing the bank lights 2x bonus.</p>

<h3>Green drop targets 4-bank</h3>

<p>Each target scores 500 points and 1 bonus advance. Completing the bank lights the #5 standup target for an extra ball.</p>

<h3>Left orbit</h3>

<p>Sends the ball back to the top of the playfield for another 1-2-3-4 lanes pickup. There are 5 star rollovers in the lane. Each one scores 100 points or 1,000 when lit, and is lit by collecting one of the numbers in 1-2-3-4-5. After completing 1-2-3-4-5, this orbit shot scores 5,000 points, and should be the primary target. </p>

<h3>Right #5 standup target</h3>

<p>Scores 500 points. Awards the #5 when lit white, and an extra ball when lit purple after completing the green drop targets.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Vulcan has a conventional in/out lane setup. All lanes score 500 points and award the corresponding number in 1-2-3-4 when lit. The out lanes can be lit alternately for a special once all of 1-2-3-4-5 is completed. </p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is advanced once for each drop target hit in either bank. Lit white drop targets give 2 advances instead of 1. <br>The only bonus multiplier is 2x. It is given for free on the final ball of the game, but can also be earned on any other ball after completing the white targets once. Max bonus is 2x 19,000 = 38,000 points. Bonus count and 2x bonus cannot be carried from ball to ball. Unlike many games, the first bonus advance is not given for free at the start of the ball, and a ball can drain with no bonus if 0 drop targets were hit.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>Specials and extra balls cannot be set to be worth points.</p>

<p>On 3 ball play, 1-2-3-4-5 numbers score 3,000 points each instead of 500, and light white targets give 3 bonus advances instead of 2.</p>
