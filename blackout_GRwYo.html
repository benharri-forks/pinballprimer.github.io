<h1 style="color:red;">Blackout (Williams, 1980)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Everything on this game gives pretty much the same points, so shoot for what is easiest and safest. Green targets advance bonus and the left orbit value; red targets light pop bumpers; yellow targets light both right spinners. Bonus multiplier carries from ball to ball unless it is maxed out at 5X, so pick some of those up from 1-2-3 lanes early on. <br>Extra ball is lit at the right saucer after collecting a max value orbit. Special is lit on the out lanes after 3 completions of the green targets.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>Score 1,000 points and a bonus advance each. Lit lanes can be rotated with lane change. Completing 1-2-3 awards a bonus multiplier. Bonus multiplier is carried from ball to ball unless it is maxed out at 5X.</p>

<h3>Bumpers</h3>

<p>Score 100 points when not lit, or 1,000 points when lit. Completing the red drop targets or hitting the small standup target just above-left of the bumpers will either light a bumper or rotate which bumpers are lit.</p>

<h3>Green targets</h3>

<p>Flashing targets give 2,000 points and a bonus advance. Solid targets give 5,000 points. Any completion of these targets score + advances the left orbit value and lights the right saucer for green award. Completing the green targets two times on a single ball lights the in lanes for 3,000 points and 3 bonus advances. Completing the green targets three times on a single ball lights the out lanes for special (worth 50,000 points in competition play, I believe). </p>

<h3>Red targets</h3>

<p>One target is always lit for 5,000 points. Hitting an unlit target scores 2,000 points. Which target is lit rotates with each spin registered by any of the game's 3 spinners. Completing the bank of targets scores an additional 10,000 points, plus one bonus advance, one lit bumper, and lighting the right saucer for red award.</p>

<h3>Yellow targets</h3>

<p>These are in the very back right of the game, and the leftmost in the back is pretty much impossible to shoot from a trap on either flipper. Lit targets score 5,000, unlit targets score 2,000. Any completion to this bank scores 10,000 points and a bonus advance, and lights the right saucer for yellow award. Completing this bank twice in a single ball lights both of the spinners on the right side of the game for 1,000 points per spin.</p>

<h3>Left spinner</h3>

<p>Always awards 100 points per spin. A hard shot to this spinner that goes around the back of the game and then through the upper right spinner backwards is considered an orbit, which scores and advances the orbit value shown just behind the left spinner. Orbit values go 5,000 - 10,000 - 15,000 - 20,000. Orbit values can also be scored and advanced by completing the green targets. Completing a 20,000 point orbit lights the right saucer for extra ball.</p>

<h3>Right spinners</h3>

<p>Both of the right side spinners direct the ball toward the 1-2-3 top lanes, but in very different ways. They are both worth 100 points per spin, but can be lit together for 1,000/spin by completing the yellow drop targets twice in a single ball.</p>

<h3>Right saucer</h3>

<p>If not lit, this saucer is worth nothing. Completing the red, yellow, or green targets lights the saucer for that colour award, which is a repeatable 5,000 points. If red, yellow, and green are all lit at once, this saucer is lit for Blackout, which scores 30,000 points and completely unlights the saucer. </p>

<p>If a 20,000 point orbit has been completed on the current ball (and if extra balls are on), this saucer is lit for extra ball.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus advance is given by any flashing green target, completing the red or yellow target banks, or going through any top lane. In lanes give 3 bonus advance when lit, and out lanes always give 3 bonus advance. Max base bonus is 29,000 points. Base bonus count cannot be carried from ball to ball.</p>

<p>Bonus multiplier is collected by completing the top 1-2-3 lanes. Bonus multiplier is carried over from ball to ball unless it is maxed out at 5X. Max total bonus is 5x 29,000 = 145,000.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table<h3>

<p>Blackout has a conventional in lane/out lane setup. In lanes score 1,000 points, or 3,000 points plus 3 bonus advance when lit. Out lanes score 2,000 points plus 3 bonus advance, or special when lit. In and out lanes are lit by completing the green targets two or three times in one ball respectively.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>Special can be set to free game, extra ball, or 50,000 points. Extra ball can only be on or off.</p>

<p>Out lane special can be set to light both out lanes at once, or just one alternately.</p>

<p>The orbit value can be not lit initially, needing to be completed once to light the 5,000 value. This makes it so that a total of 5 orbits or green target completions are needed to light extra ball instead of 4.</p>

<p>The two right spinners can be lit together or one at a time. I believe which spinner is lit would alternate with slingshots or bumper hits, in this case.</p>
