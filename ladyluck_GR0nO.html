<h1>Lady Luck (Bally Midway, 1986)</h1>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Complete drop targets to earn playing cards and advance the bonus. Change the selected suit at the in lanes or the Deuce targets on the sides of the table. Complete the standup targets behind the drops to increase the playfield multiplier for the rest of the ball and reset the drop targets. Hit all 3 Deuce targets to open a gate in the right out lane. Hitting both Star targets starts a countdown; do this when the drop targets are finished for a time 10x playfield multiplier. Hit the left orbit and captive ball a lot early on to increase the value of the left orbit and right spinner, which also keep their value from ball to ball. Everything carries over on Lady Luck default settings, so a good ball 1 is paramount.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Poker lanes</h3>

<p>The three top lanes and two in lanes combine to spell the word Poker. Roll through a lit lane to collect that letter and unlight the lane. Which lanes are lit can be rotated via lane change with the right flipper only. All lanes score 3,000 points. Unlight all 5 lanes to advance the bonus multiplier, which does carry over from ball to ball.</p>

<h3>Collecting cards</h3>

<p>At the start of the ball, one suit will be lit, and which suit that is will rotate every few seconds. Hitting any switch locks in that suit for the start of the ball. Suits can be changed later on by rolling through an in lane or hitting one of the two lower Deuce targets. The drop targets are labelled A-K-Q-J-10. Hitting a drop target scores 3,000 points and lights the card corresponding to the lit suit and the hit target. If Countdown is running (see below), hitting a drop target will light cards corresponding to the target's rank in two random suits rather than the one lit suit. All drop targets are reset at the beginning of the ball; to reset them mid-ball, you must hit all 4 of the Joker standup targets behind the drops after having knocked down all 5 drop targets.</p>

<p>Lit cards score 5,000 points each in base bonus at the end of the ball. Completing a grid of 20 cards will increase the super bonus value by 100,000 points and allow you to fill in a new grid. The super bonus can be as high as 400,000 points. After the super bonus reaches 300,000, each additional completion of the 20-card grid scores a special. An instant extra ball is awarded for every 3 columns completed across grids of cards, where a column consists of all 4 suits of a single rank card being lit.</p>

<p>Whenever a suit is changed by the in lanes or deuce targets, the lit suit will move on step down, so that the order is hearts -> clubs -> diamonds -> spades. A suit cannot be the selected suit if all 5 cards in that suit are currently lit.</p>

<h3>Joker targets</h3>

<p>After hitting all 5 drop targets, the Joker standup targets become available. All targets score 5,000 points. Hit a flashing target to light it solidly. Hitting all 4 Joker targets will increase the playfield multiplier for the rest of the ball up to 2x (first time) then 3x (second time), spot all 5 cards of the currently selected suit, and reset the drop targets. If the four Jokers are collected again when the playfield multiplier is already 3x, a special will be earned instead. Progress on the current set of jokers does carry over from ball to ball, but playfield multipliers do not.</p>

<h3>Countdown mode</h3>

<p>Hitting the two Star standup targets near the bottom of the playfield starts Countdown mode for 20 seconds. During Countdown, any drop targets that are hit will light the corresponding card in two suits instead of one. If all drop targets are down during Countdown mode, a 10x playfield multiplier will be active. The 10x playfield during Countdown does not stack with the 2x or 3x playfield earned by collecting Jokers. The number of lit star inserts between the flippers serves as a meter indicating how much time is left in Countdown (approximately 4 seconds per star).</p>

<h3>Left orbit</h3>

<p>This orbit can be shot with either right flipper, but it's much easier with the upper right flipper. Making the orbit scores the lit value (which starts at 10,000) and increases the lit value by 10,000. This orbit's value maxes out at 130,000 points. When the orbit is lit for 70,000 points, it will also be lit for a special.</p>

<h3>Captive ball and right spinner</h3>

<p>Hit the captive ball hard enough that it registers the target at the end of its lane to score 3,000 points and increase the spinner value. The spinner starts at 2,000 points per spin and is increased 2,000 at a time up to a maximum of 10,000 per spin. (If game settings dictate that the spinner is not lit at all at the start of the game, it will be worth 100 points per spin, and the first captive ball hit will increase it to 2,000.) Spinner value is held from ball to ball. Hit the captive ball a few times as early on as possible- it's generally an easier shot than the left orbit- so that the spinner is always ready for high value whenever you may have playfield multipliers active later in the game.</p>

<h3>Deuce targets and gate</h3>

<p>Hit a flashing Deuce target to light it. There are three: two on either side of the middle playfield, and one in the bumpers in no-man's land. Deuce targets always score 1,000 points. Light all three to open a gate in the right out lane, allowing it to act as a second right in lane for one use only. The right out lane scores 3,000 points instead of the usual 1,000 when the gate is open.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Lady Luck has a conventional in/out lane setup. In lanes score 1,000 points and change the currently selected suit. Out lanes score 1,000 points. See the previous section for discussion on the gate in the right out lane.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Each playing card collected over the course of the game is worth 5,000 points in base bonus. Max base bonus is 495,000 points, which is earned by completing the entire grid of 20 cards four times and then lighting 19 of the 20 cards on any grid after that. Bonus multiplier is incremented toward its maximum of 5x each time the five Poker lanes are completed. Max bonus is 5x 495,000 = 2,475,000 points. All bonus multipliers and collected playing cards are carried over from ball to ball by default, though the game can be set not to have multipliers carry over. There is no mid-ball bonus collect.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>In competition/novelty play, specials can be set to have a point value; I have not confirmed exactly what this value is, but given other Bally games from around this time, it is likely either 50,000 or 100,000 points. Extra balls cannot be set to have a point value.</p>

<p>The left orbit value, spinner value, Joker progress, and Deuce progress are all carried from ball to ball by default. Each of these features can have their carryover disabled independently from the others.</p>

<p>The card column extra ball can be awarded at every 2, 3, 4, or 5 columns.</p>

<p>The left orbit special can be lit at any value from 30,000 to 100,000. The joker special can be lit after 2 or 3 completions of the jokers on a single ball. The completed grid special can start being awarded with the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th completion of the 20-card grid.</p>

<p>Countdown mode can be set to 10, 15, 20, or 25 seconds (corresponding to 2, 3, 4, or 5 seconds per star insert on the "meter" between the flippers).</p>
