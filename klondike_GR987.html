<h1 style="text-align:center">Klondike, Yukon, Gold Rush, Jackpot (Williams, 1971)</h1>

<p>Klondike is the 1-player replay version.<br>Yukon is the 1-player add-a-ball version.<br>Gold Rush is the 4-player replay version for North America.<br>Jackpot is the 4-player replay version designed for Europe.<br>This focuses primarily on Klondike, with differences between the four being discussed at the end of the guide.</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Line up three symbols at the top playfield reels to increase the Reel Collect. One wagon can be used as a wild card, meaning you don't need three of the same symbol. Advance the reel value with the top rollover buttons, side lanes, and lower standup targets. Collect the reel value at the top lanes, any saucer, or out lanes. Hats score 3,000; pans score 4,000; lamps score 5,000 and an extra ball; three wagons scores 5,000 and a special. Collect the reel value as many times as you can if it's not worth just 500 points.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Reels</h3>

<p>The three slot machine-like reels at the top of the game dominate this game's rules. Individual reels can be advanced one step at a time. The left reel is advanced by the left rollover button, left far standup target, or left near standup target. The center reel is advanced by the center top rollover button, the center far standup target, or either side lane. The right reel is advanced by the right top rollover button, right far standup target, or right near standup target. Anything that advances any reel scores 100 points.</p>

<p>The goal is to make a set of three like symbols on the reels. One wagon can be used as a wild card, but not two; lamp-wagon-lamp is valid as three lamps, but lamp-wagon-wagon is not. (Order does not matter.) Three hats means the reel value is 3,000; three pans is 4,000; three lamps is 5,000 points and an extra ball; three wagons is 5,000 points and a special. The current reel value can be collected at either top lane, any of the three saucers, or the out lanes. All of these are difficult to shoot directly, though, since the top lanes and top saucers are obscured and the center saucer is close enough to the flippers that a direct shot lips out a significant portion of the time. Do your best with this, though, because it's more or less the only source of decent points on this table. Collecting the reel value does not change the reels themselves or alter the reel value in any way, so collect it as many times as you can without changing it once it's worth more than 500 points.</p>

<h3>Top saucers and bumpers</h3>

<p>In addition to scoring the current reel value, the top saucers light bumpers. The left saucer lights the yellow bumpers, which are the upper left and lower right. The right saucer lights the green bumpers, which are upper right and lower left. Lighting both the green and yellow bumpers will light the red center bumper as well. Yellow and green bumpers score 10 points, or 100 when lit. The red bumper scores 100 points, or 1,000 when lit.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>There are no in lanes; just an out lane, slingshot, and the flipper on each side, The flipper is below the corner of the slingshot, with a post in between. The out lanes score the current reel value.</p>

<p>There is a center post between the flippers that completely blocks the center drain. It is raised by either side lane and lowered by the rollover button immeidatley above and between the flippers.</p>

<p>There is no end of ball bonus.</p>

<h2>Differences in other versions of the game</h2>

<p>This guide focused primarily on the Klondike version of the playfield, which is the 1-player replay game. Here is how the other versions are different.</p>

<h3>Gold Rush</h3>

<p>4-player replay version for domestic (USA) distribution. There are no posts next to the hinges of the flippers, allowing a ball to drain behind the flipper similar to the Doodle Bug family of games (also Williams, 1971). A ball can only be brought to rest on the center post, as holding up a flipper will drain the ball.</p>

<h3>Yukon</h3>

<p>1-player add-a-ball version. The extra ball is not available, and a line of three lamps just gives 5,000 points, no extra ball. Three wagons scores 5,000 points and a special, but the special is extra ball. More than one extra ball can be earned per ball in play.</p>

<h3>Jackpot</h3>

<p>A 4-player version for export to Europe. The reel icons are replaced by traditional slot machine images: three cherries gives 3,000, three oranges gives 4,000, three bells gives 5,000 + extra ball, three bars gives 5,000 + special, and bars can be used as wild cards in the same way wagons could in other versions. On some early versions of the playfield, the three bars award is listed as 10,000 + special, but it only gives 5,000 points instead of the listed 10,000.</p>

<p>Supposedly, versions of the game in Italy had to replace the reels with simple numbers due to laws against gambling/slot machine imagery. I am not sure how these correlate to the slot machine icons or the old west icons.</p>
