<h1 style="color:lightskyblue;">Aces & Kings (Williams, 1970)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>The titular Ace and King standup targets are only worth going for if extra balls matter to you. To score points, make the disc in the center of the table spin by shooting the posts, which builds value of whichever colour is lit with a white arrow; switch which colour is lit by hitting switches marked Change in the walls about 2/3 of the way up the sides of the table. The left saucer collects the green value, and the right saucer collects the yellow value; this value is multiplied by 10 for a maximum possible 1,000 points if you went through the top lane of the same colour on the plunge.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>The top lanes score 100 points, or 300 when lit. One of the two will be lit at a time, alternating each time a switch in one of the walls that form the "funnel" into the top lanes is triggered. Whether lit or not, the left top lane will light the left saucer for 10x collects, and the right top lane will light the right saucer for 10x collects for the rest of the ball. It's very difficult to light both saucers in the same ball.</p>

<h3>Ace and King targets</h3>

<p>Score 10 points each. Hit a lit target to unlight it. Hitting just one Ace target lights the green bumper for 10 points, and hitting just one King target lights the yellow bumper for 10 points. Hitting all four Ace targets or all four King targets lights the saucer on the same side of the playfield for extra ball.</p>

<h3>Green and yellow bonuses</h3>

<p>At the start of the game, there are 10 points in each of the green and yellow bonuses, and one of the two colours will be lit for "increase value when lit". If the disk in the center of the table is made to spin by hitting the posts, the currently lit colour's bonus will increase by 10 points for each 1/2 turn (roughly) that the disc makes, up to a maximum of 100 points in each bonus. You can switch which colour is lit for Increase Value by hitting either of the walls marked Change on the edges of the table slightly above the disc itself.</p>

<p>The left saucer collects the green bonus, and the right saucer collects the yellow bonus. After collecting any value, that colour's bonus is reset to its base value of 10. If the ball went through the top lane on the same side as a given saucer on the current ball, all collects at that saucer will be in multiples of 100 points instead of 10. The strategy, then, is to build the bonus up as high as you can on the side of the top lane you went through on the plunge, then collect, then repeat. This is easier said than done though because of how the posts on the disc itself or the bumpers like to throw the ball into the Change switches.</p>

<p>There is no end of ball bonus. Green or yellow values are never collected for free, and they will always reset back to the default level of 10 points per side for each new ball.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>There are no in lanes. The flippers back up directly to the slingshots, which are wider than conventional slingshots on a modern day machine. Out lanes always score 100 points.</p>

<p>There is a center post between the flippers. It is raised by the Up Post button just below the red bumper, and lowered by the Down Post button in the center of the playfield. Due to their alignment, it's quite difficult to keep the post on for any decent amount of time, because after hitting the Up Post button, the ball either has a lot of side to side moment and is liable to find the Down Post, or is coming straight back down the way it came and will turn the posts off on the way to the flippers.</p>
