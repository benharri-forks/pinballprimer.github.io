<h1 style="color:red;">Firepower II (Williams, 1983)</h1>

<p>Not to be confused with its prequel, Firepower (Williams, 1980).</p>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Try to always stay in multiball. It never takes more than two shots to start multiball- one to the lock in the upper right, then one to the release target directly up the middle of the table and through the bumpers. All scoring is doubled during multiball. Top priority should be getting to the top lanes to get 5x bonus as soon as possible. Once you're at 5x, complete the Firepower standup targets once to light the left spinner and rip it a lot; if a ball ends up in the right in lane, send it up the ramp for mystery points. After completing one group of F-I-R, E-P-O, or W-E-R, the left orbit is lit for hold bonus for 10 seconds.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>Whether lit or unlit, top lanes score 1,000 points and 2 bonus advance. Go through an unlit lane to light it. Lit lanes can be rotated via lane change with the right flipper only. Completions of the top lanes advance the bonus multiplier in the sequence of 2x-3x-5x. Additional completions when the bonus multiplier is at 5x score 25,000 points.</p>

<h3>Locks and multiball</h3>

<p>During single ball play, the lane in the upper right is always lit for a lock. Locking one ball here lights the standup target in the back center of the game above the bumpers for a release. Release the locked ball for two-ball multiball. For the first multiball, the lock scores 10,000 points and the release scores 50,000. For the second multiball, the lock scores 20,000 and the release scores 100,000. Thereafter, the lock scores 50,000 and the release scores 150,000.</p>

<p>During multiball, all scoring is doubled. Shooting a ball into the lock scores 5,000 points (not doubled) and immediately kicks the ball back out. There are no multiball-specific jackpots or other scoring features, and there is no way for multiball to have more than two balls.</p>

<h3>Firepower targets</h3>

<p>Hitting any Firepower standup target scores 1,000 points. Hitting an unlit target lights it, and also scores 1 bonus advance. <br>Completing one bank of the targets- F-I-R, E-P-O, or W-E-R- lights one bumper for the rest of the ball for 1,000 points instead of 100, and lights the left orbit for Hold Bonus for 10 seconds. If you collect Hold bonus at the left orbit twice in a single ball, the second one will just give 25,000 points.</p>

<p>Awards are available for complete spellings of Firepower as well. For the first, the left spinner is lit for 1,000 points per spin (up from 100) and the in lanes are lit alternately for 3 bonus advances. For the second completion, the other in lane will be lit as well. The third completion lights the ramp shot for an extra ball. The fourth completion lights the out lanes alternately for a special. The fifth completion scores an instant special. Additional completions beyond the 5th score 50,000 points each.<br>Completions of Firepower do not carry over from ball to ball, but progress on the current spelling does.</p>

<h3>Left orbit</h3>

<p>The spinner in the left orbit scores 100 points per spin, or 1,000 per spin if it is lit after completing Firepower once. A weak orbit shot falls into the top lanes. A strong orbit shot goes all the way around the back of the table and down the right side, scoring 5,000 points and 3 bonus advances (or 10,000 plus 10 advances if the orbit was lit for Hold Bonus). </p>

<h3>Ramp shot</h3>

<p>The ramp shot scores 5,000 points when not lit for anything else. The third completion of Firepower lights the ramp for an extra ball. The right in lane lights the ramp shot for Mystery Score for seven seconds, which is a random point value between 20,000 and 99,000 points.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Firepower II has a conventional in/out lane setup. The out lanes score 10,000 points, and are lit alternately for special after completing the Firepower targets 4 times in one ball. The in lanes score 5,000 points always, and 3 bonus advances when lit. The first completion of Firepower lights one in lane alternately on bumper hits; the second completion lights the other in lanes.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Flashing Firepower targets score 1 bonus advance. Top lanes score 2 bonus advances. Unlit orbit shots and lit in lanes score 3 bonus advances. Lit orbit shots score 10 bonus advances. Bonus multiplier is advanced in the order of 2x-3x-5x by completions of the top lanes. Max bonus is 5x 99,000 = 495,000 points. Bonus cannot be collected mid-ball. The only way to hold any base bonus is to shoot the left orbit when it is lit for Hold Bonus, which is the case for 10 seconds after completing a single 3-bank of Firepower standup targets. Bonus multiplier can never be carried from ball to ball.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>In competition/novelty play, specials score 50,000 points. Extra balls cannot be assigned a point value. </p>

<p>The lock and release shots can be set to be unlit for the first multiball. If they are, the lock for the first multiball scores 5,000 points and the release for the first multiball scores 25,000.</p>

<p>The ramp mystery and the hold bonus orbit can be set to light for 5 and 7 seconds respectively isntead of 7 and 10.</p>
