<h1 style="color:yellow;">The Amazing Spider-Man (Gottlieb, 1980)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Tournament strategy: get A and/or B, preferably both, and preferably at least one off the plunge. Get the ball under control and alley pass back and forth all day to safely build both base bonus and bonus multiplier. When base bonus is maxed, shoot the spinner and get the ball in saucer #2 for a collect, then repeat.</p>

<p>More fun casual strategies: complete A+B to make it so that when the center drop target of the 5-bank is lit green, it is also lit for extra ball. Complete the 5-bank to light the 3-bank for extra ball on and off with bumper hits. Hit the standup target at the very top of the game 3 times to light special on the left standup.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>A-B lanes</h3>

<p>A is found in the top lanes and the middle right side lane. B is found in the top lanes and left candy cane side lane. Always try to get one from the top lanes off the plunge- the absolute perfect plunge is to the B top lane, then bouncing into the A side lane to get both immediately.</p>

<p>A lights the left out lane and right in lane for 5,000 points and a bonus multiplier. B does the some to the left in lane and right out lane, meaning collecting both lights all 4 bottom lanes. Why this is so important is discussed in detail in the Bottom of the table section...</p>

<p>Collecting both A and B together makes it so that if the center drop target in the right 5-bank is lit green, it will also be lit for extra ball.</p>

<h3>1-2-3 saucers</h3>

<p>Saucers always give one bonus advance. Landing in a lit saucer scores 5,000 points and unlights it. Unlit saucers are worth 500 points. <br>Unlighting all 3 saucers will relight them, add one green light to the 5-bank of drop targets, and light the #2 saucer for Scores Bonus.</p>

<p>Scores Bonus can also be lit automatically at the #2 saucer by advancing the base bonus to at least 20,000. Landing in the Scores Bonus saucer scores the entire bonus, including the multiplier, and also drains the base bonus to be built up again (but keeps the multiplier).</p>

<h3>Top standup target</h3>

<p>Always scores 500 points. The first hit lights Multi-Bonus on all of the A and B lanes, which makes them worth 5 bonus advance each.<br>The second hit lights the 3-bank of drop targets for advance bonus multiplier when completed. <br>The third hit lights a special on the left standup target.</p>

<h3>Star rollover and bumpers</h3>

<p>When lit, the star rollover scores 1,000 points, lights the bumper, and unlights itself. Unlit rollover scores 100 points.</p>

<p>Pop bumpers score 100 points, or 1,000 when lit. Each pop bumper hit also moves the green light(s) in front of the 5-bank drop targets, and toggles the extra ball light on the 3-bank after the 5-bank has been completed once.</p>

<h3>Right drop targets (5-bank)</h3>

<p>Each target scores 3,000 points and one bonus advance. Drop targets with green lights in front of them score 10,000 points and advance the bonus multiplier. There is always one green light to start. Green lights rotate with pop bumper hits. Completing the 1-2-3 saucers adds another green light to the rotation. If A and B have both been collected, the middle drop target of this bank will also be lit for extra ball when it is lit green.</p>

<p>Completing this 5-bank lights the spinner, lights an alternating extra ball on the 3-bank, and resets both drop target banks.</p>

<h3>Center drop targets (3-bank)</h3>

<p>Each target scores 3,000 points and advances bonus. Completing the bank scores 5,000 points. <br>If the top center standup has been hit twice, completing this bank advances bonus multiplier. <br>If the 5-bank of targets has been completed, finishing the 3-bank awards extra ball when lit; each pop bumper hit toggles the extra ball light on or off.</p>

<h3>Spinner</h3>

<p>Gives 100 points per spin by default. Once the 5-bank on the right has been completed once, the spinner is lit for 1,000 points <i>and a bonus advance</i> per spin. This is a great way to build up a bonus that was just drained at the Collect hole.</p>

<h3>Right A side lane and left B side lane</h3>

<p>If A/B is not collected, the corresponding lane scores that letter and 5,000 points. Otherwise, it scores only 500 points. If the top center standup has been hit once, these lane are lit for 5 bonus collect, whether A has been collected or not.</p>

<h3>Left standup target</h3>

<p>Scores 500 points and a bonus advance. If the top center target has been hit 3 times during the current ball, this target is lit for 5,000 points and a special.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>The left side of the playfield bottom is conventional. The right side has the lanes in conventional setup, but two flippers. Be mindful of a scissor drain between these flippers.<br>Unlit in or out lanes score 500 points and a bonus advance. Lit in/out lanes score 5,000 points, a bonus advance, and a bonus multiplier. The left out lane and right in lane are lit by A; the left in lane and right out lane are lit by B.</p>

<p>This is an amazing game for alley passing, if you can do it. Light one or both of A and B and then alley pass back and forth all day. This builds bonus X quickly, build base bonus safely, and the 5,000 per lane is nothing to sneeze at. The optimal tournament strategy for safe points is to do this ad nauseum, stopping only to collect the bonus at saucer #2 when it's maxed out so that the bonus can be built again.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Drop targets, in/out lanes, and the left standup advance bonus. All A/B lanes (both top and side) give 5 bonus advance when lit for multi-bonus after hitting the top center standup once.<br>Bonus multiplier can be collected at lit in/out lanes, targets lit green in the 5-bank, and for completing the 3-bank after the top center target has been hit twice.<br>Max bonus is 5x 29,000 = 145,000 points.<br>Bonus can be collected, and base bonus drained, by entering the #2 saucer when Scores Bonus is lit.<br>Neither bonus count nor bonus multiplier can be carried from ball to ball.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>On 5 ball play, drop targets score 500 each instead of 3,000, and the max base bonus is 20,000 instead of 29,000.</p>

<p>On competition settings, special and extra ball are either both worth 50,000 points, or disabled outright.</p>
