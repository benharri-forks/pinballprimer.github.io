<h1 style="color:mediumseagreen;">Royal Flush / Card Whiz (1976)</h1>

<p>Royal Flush is the 4-player version. Card Whiz is the 2-player version. The two games are functionally identical.</p>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Try to collect jokers as soon as possible from the top left lanes or the standups. After some jokers are collected, shoot the drop targets for 1,000 points plus 1,000 per lit joker. Bonus is awarded for completing certain combinations of the drop targets.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Bumper</h3>

<p>Scores 100 points on 5 ball and 1,000 points on 3 ball. Notice that the white joker collection standup is near here.</p>

<h3>Jokers</h3>

<p>Green, pink, and white jokers can each be collected at two points in the playfield: one top left lane, and one other standup target. The white joker standup is near the bumper, the pink standup is in the upper right, and the green is in the lower left. Any joker target or lane scores 500 points and collects that joker when lit.</p>

<p>The white joker lights the left orbit and the right side lane. The green joker lights the left out lane and right in lane. The pink joker lights the left in lane and right out lane. All of these lanes score 500 when not lit and 3,000 when lit. </p>

<h3>Right saucer</h3>

<p>Scores 1,000 points, plus an additional 1,000 for each lit joker. If all three jokers are lit, this hole will be lit for special alternately with 10 point switch hits. (Special can only be set to a free game or nothing.)</p>

<h3>Drop targets and bonus</h3>

<p>There are nine, in a single bank. Each target down scores 1,000 points plus 1,000 for each lit joker, maximum 4,000. Behind the black King and black Jack are 500 point targets. Behind the red Queen is a target that scores 500 points, or 3,000 when lit after all targets are down.</p>

<p>Combinations of individual drop targets knocked down affect the bonus count. There is no end of ball bonus given for free. <br>Hitting both jacks OR both kings lights the 1,000 bonus.<br>Both jacks AND both kings lights the 2,000 bonus. <br>Three queens lights the 3,000 bonus. <br>Three queens and either both jacks or both kings lights the full house for 4,000 bonus.<br>All five red targets (A-K-Q-J-10) lights the royal flush 5,000 bonus. <br>All targets down maxes the bonus at 15,000 points. <br>Bonus multiplier cannot be earned through gameplay, but double bonus is given for free on ball 5 in a 5-ball game, or on both balls 2 and 3 of a 3-ball game.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>In/out lane and flipper setup is conventional. See the Jokers section for a description of the in/out lane values and how they are lit.</p>
