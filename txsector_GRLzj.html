<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>A basic but adequate strategy just involves shooting for whichever spinner is lit. One of them always will be, and that spinner scores 10,000 points per spin. Lit in lanes swap which spinner is lit. A more advanced strategy that's only mildly more valuable involves collecting Mega Levels from lit dead end shots, completed drop target banks, or the standup target behind the right spinner; then, hit the drop target in front of the left ramp to start a hurry-up multiplier, and shoot whichever shot is lit for Teleport as soon as possible afterward. Multiball is started by shooting a lit Teleport after advancing to Level 10, but is only really good for earning an extra ball.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Mega Level and Teleports</h3>

<p>Mega Level can be increased in 5 ways: the two dead end lanes (when lit), the two drop target banks, and the standup target above the bumpers/behind the left spinner.</p>

<p>One of the two dead-end lanes will be lit, alternating with pop bumper and slingshot hits. The lit lane scores 10,000 points and increases your Mega Level. The unlit lane just scores 1,000 points.<br>Use the left dead end lane as a feed to the upper flipper at a controlled speed.</p>

<p>Each target down in either drop target bank scores 3,000 points. Completing a drop target bank initially awards 1 Mega Level. Completing both target banks increases the completion value to 2 Mega Levels, and completing both banks a second time increases the completion value to 3 Mega Levels. Completing both banks a third time resets their value to 1 Mega Level and means that a special will be lit at one of the dead-end lanes the next time multiball is played.</p>

<p>There is a standup target behind the bumpers that faces directly to the right. The best way to hit it (and hit it <i>repeatedly</i>) is to shoot the right spinner and then get the upper-right pop bumper to bop the ball into the target even more. It scores 10,000 and 1 Mega Level per hit.</p>

<p>At all times, either the side ramp or the back loop (entrance directly above the side ramp, also a left flipper shot) will be lit for Teleport. This shot will be worth 10,000 points, plus an additional 10,000 for each Mega Level currently earned. Hitting the drop target in front of the left ramp will start a hurry-up that counts down from 9x to 2x over about 16 seconds. Making a teleport during this time will multiply the value by whatever is left in the hurry-up. If you have all 10 levels, a 9x Teleport will score 990,000 points. While the drop target is down, the left ramp is a makeable shot. If the side ramp is lit for Teleport, the left ramp will only score 10,000 points (and NO teleport). If the back loop is lit for Teleport, the exposed left ramp will be lit for Teleport as well. When the multiplier hurry-up ends, the drop target in front of the left ramp re-raises.</p>

<h3>Locks and multiball</h3>

<p>After advancing to Mega Level 10, the next Teleport made at any location will lock a ball. Locking a ball scores 100,000 points in addition to the Teleport value and resets the Mega Level back to 0. A new ball is served to the plunger and 2-ball multiball will be started as soon as the second ball enters the playfield. <br>During multiball, everything is in play. Mega Level and Teleports can be scored as usual. There is no playfield multiplier. If Mega Level is advanced back to 10 during multiball, it will instantly be reset to 0 with 100,000 points scored. The only multiball-specific features are at the dead-end lanes: one of the two will be lit for extra ball at the start of any multiball, alternating with slingshot and pop bumper hits. If a 3x Mega Level has been collected from both drop target banks, the dead-end lane not lit for extra ball will be lit for special instead. There is absolutely no grace period in multiball; as soon as one ball drains, the extra ball and/or special turn off.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>TX-Sector has a conventional in/out lane setup. Out lanes score 30,000 points. In lanes score 3,000 points and light the opposite side spinner. </p>

<p>In the right out lane is a triangle of posts. There is a gap that the ball can fall in back to the shooter lane. Any ball in the right out lane can be nudged into the shooter lane through this gap via the pins. This can even be done in multiball; one ball can be left in the plunger lane while the other is played with the extra ball and special on. <b>This is a very illegal move in tournament play! If a ball takes this gap in tournament play, you must plunge it immediately or call for a tournament director for a stuck ball ruling. </b></p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is simply 10,000 points per Mega Level gained throughout the game. Up to 2 sets of 10 completed levels can be stored, leading to a max bonus of 290,000 points. There is no bonus multiplier.</p>

<h3>Settings note</h3>

<p>In competition/novelty play, extra balls and specials always score 500,000 points, which can be quite significant.</p>
