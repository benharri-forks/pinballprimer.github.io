<h1 style="color:red;">High Speed (Williams, 1986)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Success on High Speed is all about being able to hit the side ramp shot. If the upper flipper isn't powerful enough to make the side ramp, you may not want to play this game given the choice. Hit flashing stoplight targets until all 9 are lit, then run the red light with a side ramp shot, then get away with another side ramp to start multiball. In multiball, one further side ramp shot scores the progressive Hideout Jackpot. Make combos of orbit -> orbit or in lane -> opposite orbit to score Freeways, which give increasing points as well as goodies such as hold bonus, light spinners, and extra ball. The lit 1-6 target at the bottom of the playfield will relight the left kickback if you need and also increase the value of the next side ramp shot you make. </p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Skill shot</h3>

<p>High Speed doesn't really have a skill shot in the conventional sense, but there is one helpful thing you can do: full plunge so the ball goes up the side ramp, then shoot the side ramp again immediately after because ramp shots off the plunge are guaranteed to direct the ball back to the upper right flipper. Simply full plunging will spot one stoplight target; the second side ramp immediately after the first is good for another stoplight target, 50,000 points, and a bonus multiplier advance. If the side ramp is lit for Run Red Light at the beginning of your ball, this full plunge to side ramp maneuver can instantly put you in multiball.</p>

<h3>Stoplights and multiball progression</h3>

<p>Hit a flashing stoplight target to light it and score 1,000 points plus a bonus advance. At first, only the three green lights will be flashing. Make those to light the yellows; make the yellows to light the reds; make the reds to light the side ramp for Run Red Light. You can also have stoplight targets spotted for you by shooting the side ramp or the eject hole just to the left of the right orbit. (Ramp shots made from a plunge will only award a stoplight target until multiball has been played once.)</p>

<p>The side ramp scores the current Ramp Value, which starts at 50,000 points, increases by 25,000 with each lit 1-6 target hit, maxes out at 250,000, and resets to 50,000 once a ramp is made. Side ramps also advance the bonus multiplier toward the maximum of 5x. Making another side ramp after reaching 5x bonus will light hold bonus for the next ball.</p>

<p>Shoot the side ramp when the red light above it is lit to run the red light and start the Escape. During Escape, you have two options: start multiball immediately by shooting the side ramp again to get away, or try to complete the nine stoplight targets again in any order to light the eject hole for Escape, which will then give 100,000 points and the multiball start. It's usually less dangerous to just take the multiball start right away. In either case, the first ball will be held for you; you then get to plunge two more balls to the hideout locks on the sides of the game, and they will all kick out to start 3-ball multiball.</p>

<p>During multiball, any points you score from hitting targets, bumpers, or spinners gets added to the Hideout Jackpot in addition to your score. The Hideout Jackpot starts at 250,000 points. builds up between players and between games, maxes out at 2,000,000 points, and is reset to 250,000 when collected. (In competition play, the jackpot will always be 750,000 points for all players and never increases.) Shoot the side ramp once to collect the jackpot. There is only one jackpot per multiball; after scoring the jackpot, the only thing left to do is to try to hit all 9 stoplight targets yet again. Succeed, and the eject hole will be lit for extra ball. <br>Once single ball play resumes, you will be reset to the green light. There is no quick multiball restart available if you miss out on the jackpot.</p>

<p>Advancing to the red light twice in a game lights the out lanes alternately for a special.</p>

<h3>Freeways</h3>

<p>Making an orbit shot lights that orbit for a Freeway for about 9 seconds. Going through an in lane also lights the opposite in lane for a Freeway. Making a full orbit shot when lit for Freeway scores and advances the value shown on the bottom of the table between the flippers: 25,000 - 50,000 - 75,000 - 100,000 - 100,000 and lite extra ball. After lighting the extra ball, further Freeways on the same ball score 100,000 points. Progression through this sequence carries over from ball to ball, until the extra ball has been lit; after that, Freeway progress resets down to 25,000 at the start of each ball.<br>On 3-ball settings, the Freeway value at the beginning of the game may start at 50,000 instead of 25,000.</p>

<p>In addition to the above progression, the following perks are available each ball:</p>
<ul>	
	<li>1 Freeway lights the in lanes for 20,000 points and relight kickback for the rest of the ball.</li>
	<li>2 Freeways on the same ball lights the spinners (both orbits and the eject hole) for 1,000 points per spin, when they are usually worth 100/spin.</li>
	<li>3 Freeways on the same ball lights Hold Bonus.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1-6 targets</h3>

<p>One of the six targets will be lit. Bumper hits will rotate which of the 6 targets is lit. Unlit targets score 1,000 points. Lit target score 20,000 points, relight the kickback if it is not lit, and increase the Ramp Value by 25,000 points. The ramp value is 50,000 points at the start of the game, can be increased as high as 250,000 points, and resets back to 50,000 whenever the side ramp is made.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>High Speed has a conventional in/out lane setup. Out lanes score 20,000 points and three bonus advances. They can also be lit for a special by advancing to the red light twice in a single game. In lanes score 5,000 points and one bonus advance and light the opposite side orbit for a Freeway. After collecting one Freeway on a ball, the in lanes are lit for 20,000 points instead of 5,000 and will also relight the kickback.</p>

<p>There is a kickback in the left out lane. By default it is on at the start of each ball and turns off once used. Hit the lit 1-6 target or go through a lit in lane to relight it.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is advanced each time a stoplight target is hit, each time the ball goes in an in lane, and each time the eject hole is made. The out lanes advance the bonus 3 times. Bonus multipliers are awarded by making the side ramp in regular gameplay. Max bonus is 5x 69,000 = 345,000 points. There is no mid-ball bonus collect and there is no way to carry bonus multipliers from ball to ball. Base bonus can be held to the next ball by making 3 Freeways on that ball or by shooting the side ramp one more time after reaching 5x bonus.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>In competition/novelty play, specials score 250,000 points. The game manual does not list a specific point value that can be assigned to an extra ball.</p>

<p>The Freeway value can be set to always or never carry over between balls instead of only carrying over until the first Freeway extra ball is lit.</p>

<p>The side ramp and the eject hole can be set not to spot stoplight targets.</p>

<p>The out lane special can be lit after the 1st, 3rd, or 4th time reaching Red Light, instead of the 2nd.</p>

<p>The Freeways can be set so that making an unlit orbit does not light it for a Freeway; in this case, only the in lanes can light Freeways.</p>

<p>The Ramp Value can be carried over from ball to ball. By default, it resets between balls. Regardless of this setting, it will always reset to 50,000 points once collected.</p>

<p>By default, the Freeways stay lit for 9 seconds. This can be changed to 6 or 11 seconds instead. This setting is not a range: only the discrete options of 6, 9, or 11 seconds can be chosen.</p>
