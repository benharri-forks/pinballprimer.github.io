<h1 style="text-align:center">Jubilee / Darling (Williams, 1973)</h1>

<p>Jubilee is the 4-player version. Darling is the otherwise identical 2-player version.</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Bonus is always priority one. Plunge the lit top lane and try to shoot exclusively back to the top of the table with the flippers. Nothing gives nearly as many points as the end of ball bonus. If bonus is maxed at 20,000, use the flippers or the kickers just behind the flippers to get all 5 captive balls on the lit side to earn an extra ball. If you've achieved both of these tasks, just keep the ball alive and try to rack up miscellaneous points.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>One of the two top lanes will be lit, alternating on each 10 point switch hit. The unlit lane scores 100 points and 1 bonus advance. The lit lane can be set to give 2, 3, or 4 bonus advances and 200, 300, or 400 points.</p>

<h3>Bumpers and gate switch</h3>

<p>Bumpers always score 100 points. Between the bumper is a hanging two-way gate that scores 100 points and a bonus advance when registered by a ball bouncing off the bumper and going sideways.</p>

<h3>Side walls</h3>

<p>Always score 50 points.</p>

<h3>Rollover buttons</h3>

<p>Score 100 points and a bonus advance.</p>

<h3>Center captive balls</h3>

<p>There are 5 captive balls in a U-shaped structure. Hitting one ball from one side to the other in either direction scores 100 points and a bonus advance. At the start of each ball, which ever side of the U has fewer captive balls on it will be lit. Transferring all 5 balls to the lit side will score an extra ball. <br>The kickers situated directly behind the flippers should shoot into the opposite side's captive ball hard enough that it would transfer one ball around the loop. Be careful, though, of the possibilities of a ball not hitting a captive ball from a kicker or a ball that deflects off a captive ball and into the opposite out lane.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>There are no in lanes, and in place of slingshots are proper kickers. One will be lit for 300 points, and the other will score 30 points; this alternate on 10-point switch hits. Holding up a flipper and letting the ball roll off the back will cause the ball to fall into that side's kicker. These kickers should be able to score one of the captive balls.<br>Out lanes score 100 points and a bonus advance.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is advanced once by unlit top lanes, the gate between the bumpers, the rollover buttons, transferring a captive ball, and the out lanes. The lit top lane can be set to give 2, 3, or 4 bonus advances. Max bonus is 20,000 points. Bonus is doubled on the final ball of the game; there is no skill-based way to multiply the bonus. There is no carryover for base bonus, and there is no mid-ball bonus collect.</p>
