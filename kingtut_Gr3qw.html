<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>On the first two plunges, take the left and right top lanes to light the bumpers for the rest of the game; afterward, plunge the center lane to raise the center post for free. Safe, slightly grind-heavy points come from simply shooting to the top of the table and trying to take advantage of lit 10-point bumpers. Top mushroom bumpers activate the left out lane kicker and right out lane gate; they disable once used or once the N or G targets are hit respectively. Spelling all of King Tut lights a rotating special. Tilting erases all King Tut letters.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>The top lanes spell the three letters in Tut. Notice that the left and right top lanes are funneled, making it quite a bit easier to make them than the center lane. Roll through a lit lane to collect and unlight that letter; collected letters are shown in the center of the playfield. All top lanes score 100 points. The left top lane lights the red bumpers; the center top lane raises the center post between the flippers; the right top lane lights the green bumpers.</p>

<h3>Bumpers of all shapes and sizes</h3>

<p>The two mushroom bumpers just below and outside the top lanes score 10 points. The left mushroom bumper activates the automatic kickback in the left out lane, and the right mushroom bumper opens a gate in the right out lane that redirects the ball to the shooter lane.</p>

<p>Pop bumpers score 1 point or 10 points when lit. All bumpers start unlit. The top and bottom red bumpers are lit by making the left top lane. The left and right green bumpers are lit by making the right top lane.</p>

<h3>King Tut letters and Special locations</h3>

<p>The four standup targets on the sides of the playfield about halfway up each correspond to a letter in King. All of these targets score 100 points. Hit a lit target to collect that letter. Collect all four, plus the three top lanes, to spell King Tut, which lights the specials. Special can be lit at either upper side lane or the center playfield standup target, and rotates between them each time exactly 1 point is scored. The upper side lanes and center target all score 100 points; the center target also raises the center post between the flippers.<br>To my knowledge, special always scores a free game, and cannot be worth points or an extra ball.</p>

<p>Hitting the N target at any time disables the left out lane kickback if it is lit, and hitting the G target does the same to the right out lane gate if it is open.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>King Tut has no in lanes. The flippers back up directly to the slingshots. Full size three inch flippers are used. Slingshots score 1 points. Out lanes score 100 points. The upper left mushroom bumper lights the left out lane for a one time use automatic kickback. The upper right mushroom bumper lights the right out lane for a one time use gate back to the shooter lane. The center top lane and center standup target activate a center post that completely blocks off the center drain; the post is lowered if the ball drains through an out lane or if one of the small white rollover buttons near the flippers and slingshots is pressed.</p>

<p>There is no end of ball bonus. There are no extra balls. Tilt only ends the current ball in play, but also resets all King Tut letters.</p>

<h3>Differences observed in King Rex, the add-a-ball version</h3>

<ul>
	<li>All scoring is multiplied by 10.</li>
	<li>On most settings, specials score extra balls instead of free games. Up to 5 extra balls can be stored at a time. Game settings determine whether extra balls are returned to the shooter lane as is conventional, or whether they are shot back into the playfield directly from the out hole between the flippers.</li>
	<li>There is no center post or right out lane gate, but there is a left out lane kickback. Both mushroom bumpers activate the kickback, but the center top lane does not. The center standup target also activates the kickback. The white rollover buttons near the flippers disable the kickback. The N and G targets do not disable any features.</li>
	<li>Simply spelling Rex lights the rotating special; spelling Tut alone does nothing on the replay version.</li>
	<li>Spelling King Rex awards an instant extra ball; spelling King Tut does not give any immediate awards on the replay version.</li>
</ul>
