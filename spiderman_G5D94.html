<h1 style="color:red;">Spider-Man (Stern Pinball, 2007) and Spider-Man Vault Edition (Stern Pinball, 2016)</h1>

<p>These two versions of Spider-Man have the same layout and rules; the only differences are the artwork and the names of some modes. I have included both names of the modes where possible, with the 2007 version always listed first.</p>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Hit all shots lit white to start a mode and earn the opportunity to assign a 2x shot multiplier to a shot of your choice for the rest of the ball. If you complete that mode, you can then assign a 3x shot multiplier to any shot (including, and preferably, a different shot than where you put the 2x). Focus on multiplying the left orbit, side ramp, and Doc Ock scoop before the other shots. Hit a major villain shot a lot to start an untimed Villain mode (left standups, side ramp, center ramp/toy, Doc Ock scoop). Hitting the web target between the left orbit and side ramp lights locks for standard multiball. All of Doc Ock's modes are also multiballs. Use multiballs as a chance to make difficult or dangerous shots like the Sandman center ramp with a safety net in the form of another ball. To really improve your score or complete the game progression, make sure you can hit the side ramp consistently, because later on in the game's rules, the left ramp will stop counting for Venom shots and only the side ramp will help you advance.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Skill shot</h3>

<p>Two skill shots are available to you.</p>

<p>A full plunge will send the ball into the WEB top lanes, with one of the three lanes flashing. Move the flashing light with either flipper lane change. Ball through flashing lane scores 250,000 points (plus 25,000 for each previously successful skill shot) and +5 bonus multiplier. If you make this skill shot on the final ball of the game, your entire end of ball bonus will be doubled on top of the application of the regular bonus multiplier.</p>

<p>A short plunge can put the ball directly at the upper right flipper. Immediately put the ball up the side ramp to score 500,000 points (plus 50,000 for previous skill shots), earn 1 shot's worth of credit toward the next Venom mode, and increase the Venom value by 100,000. Making this skill shot on the final ball of the game will triple your entire end of ball bonus.</p>

<h3>Shot multipliers and white modes</h3>

<p>Six shots in the game have white arrow lights: the left orbit, side ramp, left ramp, right ramp, Doc Ock scoop, and right orbit. Make all of the shots with white lights to start a white mode and qualify a shot multiplier. When a shot multiplier is ready, the next white light shot that you make will have a 2x shot multiplier for the rest of the ball. If you complete the mode, you get the chance to place a 3x shot multiplier at any lit white shot, which can be the same shot or a different shot as the 2x you placed at the start of the mode. If you place a 3x multiplier on a shot that previously had a 2x multiplier, the multiplier will upgrade to 3x. If you place a 3x multiplier on a shot with any multiplier, or if you place a 2x multiplier on a shot that already has 2x, the shot multiplier will not be used up; it will stay qualified until you hit a shot that the multiplier would properly upgrade.<br>The most important things to multiply are the left orbit, the side ramp, and the Doc Ock saucer shot. The right ramp should only be multiplied if you are close to Battle Royale mode, which requires beating level 1 and level 2 of all villains and is described further later. Shot multipliers on the left ramp and right orbit are largely irrelevant.</p>

<p>Pop bumper hits rotate which mode will be started when you complete the white lit shots. The mode starts immediately upon collecting the last white shot. All white modes operate under a 40 second timer. The five white modes are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><u>New Goblin / Jack o Lantern:</u> shoot the left or right ramps (not the side ramp) a total of 6 times. Starting value is 600,000 points, shot value increases by 200,000 points each time you change which ramp you hit.</li>
	<li><u>Daily Bugle:</u> hit any Spider Sense target in the lower right, followed by any major shot. Repeat this 3 times. Shots start at 600,000 points, increasing by 200,000 each time.</li>
	<li><u>The Amazing Spider-Man:</u> hit all six major shots. Scores are once again 600,000, +200,000 each time.</li>
	<li><u>Bonesaw / Electro:</u> make a total of 100 switch hits anywhere in the game. Left orbit shots are most valuable here, since each spinner spin and bumper hit counts for a switch. All switches score 100,000 points during this mode, but individual switch hits can be multiplied by shot multipliers. If you start Bonesaw at the same time as a multiball, you can intentionally let balls drain during the ball save time so that they get autoplunged back into the pop bumpers for more quick switch hits.</li>
	<li><u>Rescue MJ:</u> make a total of 8 lit shots. 2 or 3 lit shots are available at any time. Lit shots move when one is made or after a few seconds pass. Scores are 750,000, +50,000 each time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Playing, but not necessarily completing, all 5 white modes is required to qualify Super Hero wizard mode. Once all five modes have been played, you cannot play any more white modes until making it all the way to Super Hero wizard mode; however, you can continue to complete sets of white lights during single ball play for the right to place more 2x shot multipliers, if you need. <br>Modes can be started at the same time as multiball or be brought into multiball, but modes cannot be started and progress toward a 2x shot multiplier cannot be made when multiball is already running. A shot multiplier can be placed during a multiball, if it was qualified before the multiball started or if a white mode was brought into multiball and completed during the multiball.</p>

<h3>Villain modes, including Battle Royale mini-wizard mode</h3>

<p>There are 4 villains, each with three modes always played in the same order. In general, progressing through villain modes requires hitting their corresponding shot quite a few times: the lower left standup targets for Green Goblin, the side ramp for Venom, the center ramp/toy for Sandman, and the scoop for Doc Ock / Doctor Octopus. Villain modes are untimed (with one exception), continue from ball to ball even if you drain, can run concurrently with other villains, and can be started at any time including multiball. All villain modes are listed below alongside how they are qualified.</p>

<p><u>Venom</u><br>
The Venom Value is an icnreasing award that starts at 250,000 points and increases by 1,250 with each spinner spin, 25,000 with each Venom Battle win, and 100,000 with a successful side ramp skill shot. Side ramp shots that do not occur during a Venom mode score the Venom Value as well.<br>
<i>Level 1: Goo On You</i> Starts with one shot to the side ramp. A hurry-up worth 1,000,000 points starts at the left or side ramp. Collect the hurry-up and it will restart with 250,000 more points. The hurry-ups all time out at 500,000 points. Collect a total of 4 hurry-ups, or let any hurry-up time out, and this mode will be completed.<br>
<i>Level 2: Brock's New Suit / Symbiote Stalker </i>Make 4 left or side ramp shots to start, then make 6 left or side ramp shots to win. All shots score the Venom Value.<br>
<i>Level 3: You Ooze, You Lose / Venom Strikes Twice</i> Make 4 side ramp shots to start, make 8 side ramp shots to win. All shot score the Venom Value. Left ramp shots do not count.</p>

<p><u>Green Goblin</u><br>
All Green Goblin modes start by completing the bank of green standup targets in the lower left of the game, then hitting any of the 5 targets one more time.<br>
<i>Level 1: Unity Day Festival / Green with Envy</i> Hit any target a total of 6 times. 750,000 per target hit, 3,000,000 completion bonus.<br>
<i>Level 2: Suffer the Children / Fire Fighting</i> One target will flash, moving occasionally. Each hit scores 1,250,000. Eight total hits completes the mode with a 4,000,000 completion bonus.<br>
<i>Level 3: Godspeed Spider-Man / Sidey Falls for MJ</i> Same as Level 2, but each hit score 1,375,000 and you need 12 total hits for a 6,000,000 completion bonus.</p>

<p><u>Doc Ock / Doctor Octopus</u><br>
All of Doc Ock's modes are quick multiballs. Keep this in mind when working toward starting white modes and/or getting shot multipliers qualified. Ending a Doc Ock multiball counts as completing that mode.<br>
<i>Level 1: Fusion Malfunction / Lend me a Hand</i> Requires 2 shots to Doc Ock to start. 2-ball multiball. Shots lit red score jackpots worth 250,000 points. Collect 5 jackpots and a Super Jackpot worth 5x the normal jackpot will be lit at the scoop. Collect it, and the process resets with all jackpots increased by 25,000 (meaning the Super Jackpot increases by 125,000).<br>
<i>Level 2: Bank Bust / Ock's Oscorp Outing</i> Requires 4 Doc Ock shots to start. When you start the multiball, your ball will be trapped by a magnet, and a new ball will be autoplunged. A hurry-up starts at 750,000 and counts down to 400,000. If you hit the magnetized ball to knock it off the magnet, your jackpot for this multiball will be whatever was left on the hurry-up. Fail, and the magnetized ball will be let free and you play with the base jackpot value of 400,000 points. Now, hit all lit red shots for jackpots. Collect them all and the Super Jackpot will be lit at the scoop for a value equal to the sum of all collected jackpots. Collecting a Super Jackpot resets the regular jackpots at the lit red shots.<br>
<i>Level 3: Armed at the Dock / Battle on the Bridge</i> A very worthwhile 4-ball multiball that requires 6 total Doc Ock shots to start. All major shots score jackpots worth 400,000 points. Super Jackpot is lit immediately at the scoop. The Super Jackpot is equal to the values of all regular jackpots collected to that point, and also increases the base jackpot value by 50,000 points, but also increases the number of intermediate jackpots before the next Super is lit by 1.</p>

<p><u>Sandman</u><br>
All Sandman modes start by completing the bank of retracting yellow targets between the left and right ramps. Before hitting any target, you can complete the bank in one shot by hitting the moving flashing target. You can also complete the bank by hitting all three targets. Once the bank is lowered, the standup targets on either side score 1 hit, and the Sandman figure scores 2 hits and double points.<br>
<i>Level 1: Slammer Time / Out of the Slammer</i> 6 hits required. Hits score 300,000. 2,000,000 completion bonus.<br>
<i>Level 2: Time is Money</i> 8 hits required, Hits score 350,000. 4,000,000 completion bonus.<br>
<i>Level 3: Concrete Ending</i> 12 hits required, Hits score 400,000. 6,000,000 completion bonus.</p>

<p>Completing any level of any villain lights the major shots around the playfield red for Spiders. Spiders are usually worth about 300,000 - 400,000 points each before shot multipliers. Collected spiders also each contribute

<p>Completing Level 2 mode of all 4 villains will light the left orbit for Battle Royale. When Battle Royale is ready, if it is the final ball of the game, the out lanes will be lit for Last Chance, which is a ball saver. If you see that Battle Royale is ready, now might be a good time to put a shot multiplier on the right ramp if you can. Battle Royale is a 4-ball multiball whose rules play out like so:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The normal shot value is 250,000 points, plus 25,000 for each Royale Jackpot collected.</li>
	<li>Villain shots score 750,000 points plus 50,000 for each RJ collected, but revert to the normal value after being hit once.</li>
	<li>After hitting each of the 4 villain shots once each, the right ramp is lit for Royale Jackpot, which is equal to the sum of all shots made during Battle Royale so far. Shot multipliers can be applied to villain shots, standard shots, <i>and to the Royale Jackpot itself</i>.
	<li>Hit all lit red spider shots to add 1,500,000 to the RJ, plus an additional 250,000 for each already collected RJ.</li>
	<li>The left ramp counts as a Venom shot for the first two RJs only. After that, only the side ramp gives Venom credit toward additional RJs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Standard multiball: Black Suit</h3>

<p>Hit the Web white standup target between the left orbit and the side ramp to increase the spinner value by 2,500 points per spin and make progress toward lighting a lock on either orbit. For the first Black Suit multiball, just one shot to this target is needed per lock, but this increases by 1 shot per lock with each multiball played. You cannot light the next lock until making the previous one. Lock 3 balls to start Black Suit Multiball.</p>

<p>During Black Suit multiball, each of the 6 major shots is lit for two jackpots, as shown by the red and white arrows. The jackpot value is 250,000 points plus an additional 500 points for each pop bumper hit during the entire game so far. If you collect all 12 jackpots, you can now collect 4 super jackpots: 2 super jackpots at the left ramp are worth 4x the base jackpot value, and 2 double super jackpots at the side ramp score 8x the regular jackpot value. If you collect all 4 of these, the 12 jackpot round starts again.</p>

<p>A white mode can be started at the same time as Black Suit or be brought into Black Suit, but you cannot start new white modes if Black Suit was already running. Since Black Suit uses all of the table's red and white shot lights, it can be difficult to see which shots you still need to complete for whatever mode you brought in. <br>Progress can be made on any villain's modes during Black Suit. Black Suit and Doc Ock multiballs can run at the same time and be started in either order. As soon as you start the second one, the multiball instantly becomes a 4-ball multiball.</p>

<h3>Spider Sense lane</h3>

<p>Complete the 3-bank of lower right standup targets to add an award to the Spider Sense lane whose entrance requires raising the upper right flipper. What award you get is shown on the DMD: if a mode or multiball is running, the Spider Sense award is usually something helpful to your current situation, such as a spotted shot, more mode time, or an add-a-ball to the multiball. Sometimes, though, you just get points.</p>

<h3>Super Hero: wizard mode</h3>

<p>After playing all 5 white modes, playing Battle Royale, and completing Level 3 of all 4 Villains, the left orbit is lit for Super Hero, the game's wizard mode. Like with Battle Royale, if you are on the last ball of the game, the out lanes will light for a Last Chance ball save: however, if you used 1 or 2 Last Chances on Battle Royale, you will have 1 or 0 Last Chances remaining for Super Hero. <br>Super Hero is a 5-stage wizard mode. It starts as a 4-ball multiball, but continues when you go down to a single ball; it is also untimed, so the only ways to end the mode are to complete phase 5 or drain out completely. Shot multipliers do not apply in Super Hero, which is okay, because everything is worth more than enough points as it is. Here's what you do:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The six major playfield shots all light red. Make them all for 2,500,000 points apiece.</li>
	<li>Hit each villain shot once for 3,000,000 apiece. Sandman and Doc Ock will move up and down, so you have to time your shot to actually make it into their holes. The left ramp does not count for Venom's shot, only the side ramp does.</li>
	<li>The six major playfield shots all light white. Hit a white shot to score 3,500,000 points and turn it red. If you hit a red shot, it will go back to white. The goal is to turn all 6 shots red.</li>
	<li>Shoot the Sandman hole repeatedly for 4,000,000 points per shot. The number of shots required is just 3 of you make it all the way to Super Hero on ball 1 with no extra balls, but each ball played adds 1 to the number of required shots to Sandman's hole.</li>
	<li>Shoot the Spider Sense lane underneath/behind the upper right flipper to complete the wizard mode and earn the Super Hero jackpot of 250,000,000 points.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Spider Sense lane adds a ball to the playfield during each of the first 4 phases. One ball is also added to the playfield each time you complete a phase.<br>After you win, the flippers are locked so the ball(s) can drain and a big celebration happens, followed by you starting all of your game progress over with one catch: all playfield scores are doubled for the rest of this ball! This lies on top of the shot multiplier you've collected, so shots you've attached a doubler to are now 4x and shots you've attached a tripler to are now 6x. Go to town, have fun, and watch number go up. I'm not sure if beating Super Hero twice on the same ball increases the playfield multiplier again...if you are able to find out, I would love to know, but if you can actually pull that off, your name is probably Jason Zahler and you definitely don't need this guide. :)</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Spider-Man has a conventional in/out lane setup. The four in and out lanes spell Hero; roll through a lit lane to light it and use either flipper lane change to move the lit lights. Spelling Hero increases the end of ball bonus multiplier by 1x. <br>When Battle Royale or Super Hero is lit, the out lanes may be lit for Last Chance on the final ball of the game. This is a one time use ball saver. If only one out lane is lit for Last Chance, lane change can be used to switch which out lane is lit.<br>There is a center peg between the flippers that can be used to save fast center drains. Rejects from the left ramp are when this gets used the most.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is a count of switch hits made on that ball plus an additional 5,000 points for every red spider collected throughout the game. Bonus multiplier is advanced by completing the WEB top lanes or the HERO bottom lanes, and the top lane skill shot adds +5x to the bonus multiplier. Bonus is also doubled or tripled on the last ball of the game on top of the standard bonus multiplier if you make the top lanes skill shot or side ramp skill shot respectively. You cannot double or triple the bonus multiple times by making multiple skill shots on the final ball of the game, which is normally only possible by winning the Super Hero wizard mode since all multiball locks are virtual. There is no way to carry bonus multiplier over from ball to ball, nor is there any kind of mid-ball bonus collect.</p>
