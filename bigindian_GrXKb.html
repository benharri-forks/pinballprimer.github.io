<h1>Big Indian / Big Brave (Gottlieb, 1974)</h1>

<p>Big Indian is the 4-player version. Big Brave is the otherwise identical 2-player version.</p>

<p>This game is included on The Pinball Primer for the purposes of education and historical completeness only. The Pinball Primer does not uphold or condone the insensitive and stereotypical depictions of Native Americans as seen in this game's artwork.</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>On the plunge, land in the I top lane, is there's nowhere else to get it. Keep shooting to the top of the table to get the other two letters in Big to light more features on the table. Then, shoot the vary-target; full hits score 5,000 points and 5 bonus advances. Ignore the upper side lanes. The drop targets give 5,000 points when completed, plus a special if Big is completed as well.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Big letters</h3>

<p>The top lanes spell Big and always score 500 points and a bonus advance each. Roll through a lit lane to unlight it. The B and G can also be collected from the middle side lanes, and also score 500 points and a bonus advance there as well. The I can only be collected from the top lanes; plunge this if you can. Notice that since the top lanes are separated from other geometry on the sides, it's very possible to avoid getting a letter at all on a trip to the top of the table, which is not ideal.</p>

<p>Collecting B lights the left in lane for 500 points and a bonus advance and lights the left bumper for 100 points. Collecting I lights the center standup target for 500 points and a bonus advance, and also lights the out lanes to be worth 5,000 points <i>instead of</i> 500 and an advance. Collecting G lights the right standup target and the right in lane for 500 points and a bonus advance, and also lights the right bumper for 100 points. Each letter in Big also lights one of the star rollovers on the right side's back-to-the-top shot for 100 points and a bonus advance instead of just 10 points. Spelling Big in its entirety lights the drop targets for a special.</p>

<p>On a 3-ball game, the B and G are tied together, so that collecting either one gives credit for both. On a 5-ball game, all three letters in Big must be completed separately. Collected Big letters never carry from ball to ball.</p>

<h3>Upper left drop targets</h3>

<p>Each target down scores 500 points and a bonus advance. Completing the 5-bank scores 5,000 points, plus a special if Big has already been completed, and resets the drop targets.</p>

<h3>Vary-target</h3>

<p>The vary-target recognizes six different strengths of shot: from weakest to strongest, they score 1,000, 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, or 5,000 + 5 bonus advances. This is the most valuable and score-efficient feature in the game, but a shot missed too early can center drain and a shot missed too late can left out lane drain off the posts on either side of the vary-target, so there's high risk and high reward here. The return feed after a successful shot to the target itself should be pretty friendly toward the right flipper, though.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Big Indian has a conventional in/out lane setup. Out lanes score 500 points and a bonus advance, or 5,000 points (and no bonus) when lit by collecting the I in Big. In lanes score 100 points or 500 and a bonus advance when lit by collecting the B (left) and G (right) letters in Big.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is advanced by any top/side lane, drop target, unlit out lane, lit in lane, lit star rollover, or lit standup target. Bonus is advanced 5 times by a full shot to the vary-target. Bonus is multiplied on the final ball of the game only; double bonus is not an earnable skill award. Max bonus is 15,000 points, or 30,000 points on the final ball of the game. Barring multiple completions of the drop targets or multiple strong hits to the vary-target, end of ball bonus will usually be worth more than the points from the ball in play itself, to take care not to tilt unless you're trying to avoid a house ball or other situation where there's almost no bonus to lose.</p>
