<h1>Flip-a-Card / Card Trix (Gottlieb, 1970)</h1>

<p>Flip-a-Card is the replay version. Card Trix is the add-a-ball version. This guide focuses primarily on Flip-a-Card, with differences observed in Card Trix mentioned at the end of the guide.</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>The Ace side lane on the middle-right dominates scoring. From the left flipper, shoot it directly from below. From the right flipper, shoot to the top of the game and try to nudge the ball to the right so it hits the Ace lane coming down. Collecting all of the cards is only good for lighting specials, which score free games. The Spin feature randomly spots a card from 5 through Ace (not 2-3-4; can be a card you already have) and scores its value.</p>

<p>The below picture is of Flip-a-Card, which was taken from the VPX recreation by Teisen.</p>

<h2>General rules</h2>

<p>Hit lit standup targets and rollover lanes to score playing cards.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Ace: middle right side lane</li>
	<li>2-3-4-5: standup targets in lower playfield</li>
	<li>6: rollover lane just to the left of the Ace lane</li>
	<li>7-8: standup targets near the top of the playfield that require pop bumper love</li>
	<li>9: upper left standup target</li>
	<li>10: middle left side lane</li>
	<li>J-Q-K: each correspond to 2 of the 6 top lanes</li>
</ul>
<p>Jack and Queen score 100 points; King scores 300 points; Ace scores 500 points. A good shot to the Ace lane from below can hit the switch going up and going down, for a chance at a colossal 1,000 points.</p>

<p>The center Spin saucer and out lanes spin the spot card wheel. This randomly awards credit for one card between 5 and Ace inclusive; it cannot award the 2, 3, or 4. Spotting a card awards that card's normal value (50, 100, 300, or 500 points).</p>

<p>10 point bumpers are always lit, unless the game is counting off something else that was scored, like a 50 or 300 or 500 point target/lane. The center bumper toggles being on or off every time a multiple of 100 points is crossed.</p>

<p>Collecting all 13 cards lights the Ace lane on the right, the right in lane feeding the flipper, and an Ace spin on the wheel for Special. Special stays lit for the rest of the game.</p>

<p>There is no left in lane, and the flipper backs up directly to the slingshot. The right side of the table bottom has a conventional in/out lane setup. The in lane scores 50 points when not lit for Special. Out lanes spin the card wheel. The only time the out lanes are not lit is when other features are being scored. There is no end of ball bonus. Tilt ends game.</p>

<h2>Differences seen in Card Trix, the add-a-ball version</h2>

<ul>
	<li>All scoring is multiplied by 10, adding a dummy 0 score reel to the end of the score.</li>
	<li>Only 3 top lanes are lit at a time: either the left three, or the right three, but never both or neither. These toggle every time a 100-point switch is scored. The same mechanism toggles whether the yellow bumpers are lit or not; they are not always lit, as they are on Flip-a-Card.</li>
	<li>Rather than Specials, Card Trix awards extra balls, which are a little easier to earn. Spinning an Ace on the spot wheel always awards 1 extra ball. Completing A-K-Q-J-10 lights the Ace lane for Wow. Completing 2 through 9 lights the right in lane for Wow. Completing all 13 cards awards an instant extra ball, and lights the Spin saucer for extra ball as well. More than one extra ball can be earned per ball in play, to a maximum of 10 total balls remaining.</li>
	<li>If the ball drains with all 13 cards collected, the entire sequence is reset, and all Wows are unlit (except for the Wow earned for spinning an Ace). Flip-a-Card never resets progress on collected cards.</li>
	<li>Out lanes do not automatically spin the wheel; rather, the left out lane is a duplicate Ace lane, and the right out lane is a duplicate 10 lane. The wheel can only be spun from the center saucer. The left out lane is never lit for Wow, even if the middle right side Ace lane has Wow lit.</li>
	<li>Tilt does not end game: tilt penalty is ball in play plus one additional ball.</li>
</ul>
