<h1 style="color:lightblue;">Mystic (Bally, 1980)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>First, shoot drop targets to fill in the tic tac toe board, getting 3 in a row whenever possible. Second, shoot the captive ball for bonus X. Last, if bonus is very high or maxed, shoot lit spinners as much as possible.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top saucer</h3>

<p>The saucer scores 500 points, spots one star light, and lights both spinners.</p>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>Together with the in lanes, these form the 4 stars on the playfield. A lit star is one you do NOT have yet. Collecting all 4 stars scores 10,000 points; do it twice in one ball for extra ball and three times in one ball for special.</p>

<h3>Bumpers</h3>

<p>Score 100 points each and switch the currently lit symbol, between pyramids and eyes.</p>

<h3>Spinners</h3>

<p>Score a measly 10 points per spin when not lit. Both spinners can be lit alternately for the rest of the ball by entering the saucer. Lit spinners score 1,000 points per spin, so lighting them is significant. Note that the spinners light as both-or-neither, not one-or-the-other. Bumpers alternate whether the spinners are lit or not.</p>

<h3>Captive ball</h3>

<p>The captive ball must be hit hard enough to register against the target at the end of the lane, which can be somewhat difficult. Every hit scores 5,000 points and the following award:</p>
<ol>
	<li>nothing</li>
	<li>2x bonus</li>
	<li>3x bonus</li>
	<li>4x bonus</li>
	<li>special</li>
	<li>and on: 25,000</li>
</ol>

<h3>Drop targets and tic-tac-toe board</h3>

<p>Each drop target corresponds to a box on the board in the middle of the playfield; small diagrams near each target display this. The left, center, and right banks of drop targets fill the left, center, and right columns of the board respectively.</p>

<p>Knocking down any drop target fills the designated box with either a pyramid or eye depending on which symbol is lit in front of the targets. If a box already has a symbol in it, that target can be used to overwrite that symbol with the opposite one. Each individual 3-bank resets when all targets are down. If a column is filled with 3 of the same symbol, that drop target bank will lock; symbols cannot be changed, and all drop targets score 2,000 points each.</p>

<p>Every 3-in-a-line advances the circled bonus numbers by 9,000. If the circled bonus reaches 72,000, the board will reset for the next ball; completing the board again scores a special.</p>

<p>Symbols on the tic-tac-toe grid carry from ball to ball unless all 9 boxes are filled with a symbol. If all 9 boxes are every filled with the same symbol, either 2 or 3 specials awarded, based on settings.</p>

<p>End of ball bonus is scored as 3,000 per box that currently has a lit symbol, plus the lit circled number for 3-in-a-rows, all multiplied by the bonus X. </p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Mystic has a conventional in lane/out lane setup. Out lanes score 1,000 points and cannot be lit. In lanes score 500 points and contain stars. Collecting the stars on the two in lanes in addition to the stars at the top of the playfield scores 10,000 points; doing so twice in a ball scores the extra ball, and 3 times in a ball scores a special.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>The captive ball can be set to award 5,000 and 2X bonus on the first hit, removing the need to light the 2X bonus first and making all awards take one fewer shot.</p>

<p>The tic-tac-toe grid can be reset between every ball, or only after balls where it was completed.</p>

<p>The award for completing a grid with the same symbol in every box can be set to 2 specials or 3 specials.</p>

<p>For competition/novelty play, specials can be set to award 50,000 points, and extra balls can be set to award 25,000.</p>

<p>By default, the bonus multiplier/progress on the captive ball awards and the progress toward star lanes is not carried between balls, but there are settings that do allow them to be held over.</p>

<p>The spinners can be set to always stay on when lit rather than alternating with slingshot and bumper hits.</p>
