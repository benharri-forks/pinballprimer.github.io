<h1 style="color:magenta;">Dealer's Choice (1973) / Lucky Ace (1974) (Williams)</h1>

<p>Dealer's Choice is the 4 player version. Lucky Ace is a 1 player version. The two games have nearly identical rules and scoring; the guide focuses on Dealer's Choice, and minor differences in Lucky Ace are mentioned at the end.</p>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Roll over all of the 1-9 buttons once for double bonus, twice for triple bonus, and specials after that (which can be worth points). Complete the 10-A standups on the left once to light extra ball on the in lane, twice to light side lane special. Advance bonus at the top lanes or any standup target with a green playfield message.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>One lane on each side with a very wide gap in the middle. The lanes score 100 points and advance bonus. The middle just feeds into the 100 point bumpers. Directly above the middle of the gap is a 1,000 point rollover button. In general, aim for the bonus advance. </p>

<h3>Upper standup targets</h3>

<p>The two uppermost standup targets, one on each side of the table, score 100 points and advance the bonus. Immediately to the left of and below the upper left advance bonus target is a target that gives 1,000 points directly.</p>

<h3>Left 10-Ace standups</h3>

<p>Hitting a target scores 10 points (!?) and lights it. Completing the straight flush once lights the right in lane for extra ball. Completing it a second time lights the upper side lane for Special, which can score a free game or 5,000 points. If the special is collected, it turns off, but it can be relit by completing 10-Ace an additional time. </p>

<h3>Upper right side lane</h3>

<p>Scores 1,000 points when not lit for Special as outlined above.</p>

<h3>1-9 rollover buttons</h3>

<p>All buttons start out lit. Rolling over a button scores 50 points and unlights it. (If more than one button is hit in a single shot/in quick succession, which is exceedingly common, only one will be scored due to slow EM score motors.) The first two completions of 1-9 light double and triple bonus respectively. Any subsequent completions on the same ball score a Special directly which, like above, can score a free game or 5,000 points. </p>

<h3>Lower left standup target</h3>

<p>Also scores 100 points and a bonus advance.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>The left side of the table bottom has no in lane. There is only an out lane, and a double flipper. It is possible to drain between the two flippers, so be careful using the lower left flipper to gain control of the ball. The left out lane is worth 1,000 points.</p>

<p>The right side is a conventional in/out lane setup. Both the in and out lanes score 1,000 points. The right in lane is lit for extra ball after one completion of 10-Ace. <br>Note that immediately above this structure is the upper right flipper. If the ball is travelling toward a raised upper right flipper, take care not to release the flipper button at the wrong time and dunk the ball into the out lane.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is advanced at the top lanes, the upper left and upper right standups, and the lower left standup. (Everything that advances bonus is clearly designated as such with a message in a green trapezoid.) Max bonus is 10,000 points. Bonus multipliers are awarded from the first two completions of the 1-9 rollover buttons. Max bonus multiplier is 3X. Base bonus and bonus multipliers cannot be carried from ball to ball.</p>

<h3>Settings</h3>

<p>Only one of note, termed "Replay/Extra Ball adjustment". This can set specials and high scores to award replays; or, it sets high scores to award extra balls and specials to award 5,000 points. In competition play, the game is likely set to the latter option, with extra balls disabled separately. This setting does not affect the functionality of the right in lane extra ball; extra balls cannot be set to be worth points.</p>

<h2>Differences between Dealer's Choice and Lucky Ace</h2>

<p>On Lucky Ace, the uppermost of the three bumpers scores 1,000 points instead of 100, while the rollover button at the very top of the game scores 100 points and a bonus advance instead of a flat 1,000 points.</p>
