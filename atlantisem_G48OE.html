<h1 style="color:lightseagreen;">Atlantis (Gottlieb, 1975)</h1>

<p>Not to be confused with the alphanumeric game Atlantis (Bally Midway, 1989).</p>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Drop targets are where it's at. For the first only time on an electromechanical table, <i>try</i> to hit 2 adjacent drop targets at once- the game detects this and awards 5,000 points for it. If the ball is in a position where it could go down a lane lit yellow, nudge it in that direction for 3,000 points. To light the specials around the table, complete 1-9, by either going through the lit numbered lanes or spotting them with lit lanes and targets labelled Advance.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top of the table</h3>

<p>One of the three lanes will be lit yellow for 3,000 points and an advance. Unlit lanes score 500 points. The switch to the right of the lanes that forms a half-funnel also scores 500 points. Anything in the game that scores exactly 500 points (unlit lanes, single drop targets, the previously mentioned switch) rotates which of three lanes is lit. The "advance" from the lit lane spots the next number in the 1-9 sequence. If 1-9 has been finished, a lit lane does nothing besides score the 3,000 points.</p>

<h3>Drop targets- left side</h3>

<p>Individual targets score 500 points each. Hitting two adjacent targets at the same time is something this game can actually detect, and rewards you with 5,000 points. Completing the entire 10-bank scores an additional 5,000 points and resets all of the targets. If the 1-9 sequence has been completed, a completion of the drop targets also scores a special.</p>

<h3>Waterfall structure and 1-9 lanes</h3>

<p>The four pairs of lanes on the right side of the table are known as a waterfall. The ball enters the structure from the top and bounces its way down, using the posts (and nudging) to occasionally switch which of the two lanes it goes down. The ball may also leave the waterfall early out the left side through one of the gaps between the triangles. The top pair of lanes is 6-1; the second pair is 2-7; the third pair is 8-3; the bottom pair is 4-9. <br>Lit lanes score 3,000 points and advance which number lane is lit. Unlit lanes score 500 points. At the beginning of the game, the 1 is lit; collecting the 1 or hitting an Advance target or lane moves the light to the 2, etc. Collecting the 9 to complete the set lights the specials around the playfield at the left out lane, the drop targets, and the standup targets up the right side of the table. Once 1-9 is completed, they do not reset, and none of the 1-9 lanes will be lit for 3,000 points for the rest of the game.</p>

<h3>Standup targets</h3>

<p>Each target scores 100 points. By rolling over the Targets On star rollover in the center of the playfield, one of the three targets will be lit for either Advance (if the 1-9 sequence has not been completed yet) or Special (if it has). One of the three targets will be lit; they are tied to which of the top lanes is lit, and also rotate every time a scoring feature worth 500 points is triggered. The lit target will be turned off by rolling over the Targets Off star rollover in the center-left of the playfield, which commonly occurs on a shot toward the drop targets.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>On the left of the table bottom, the conventional triangle slingshot is replaced by a thin rail sling. This makes room for two separate out lanes under the slingshot. The leftmost lane scores 1,000 points, and is lit for special by completing the 1-9 numbers. The lane that is closer to the center of the table is the #5 lane, and scores 500 points or 3,000 when lit like all other numbered lanes.<br>On the right of the table bottom, the 4 and 9 lanes from the base of the waterfall double as the in/out lanes. The in lane rail is cut off, though, so a ball can roll up the right flipper and into the out lane, or a ball going through the 9 lane can be nudged back into play off a small post in the out lane area. Be careful not to try to catch a ball by simply holding up the right flipper, or it may roll out; try live catching or deadbouncing instead to get the ball under control. A similar cut off in lane setup is seen on 300 and Centigrade 37.</p>

<h3>Bonus?</h3>

<p>There is no end of ball bonus. Progress on the 1-9 lanes as well as whether or not the standup targets are lit carries over from ball to ball. Tilt ends the whole game, so be careful.</p>
