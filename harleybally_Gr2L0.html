<h1 style="color:darkorange;">Harley Davidson (Bally Williams, 1991)</h1>

<p>Not to be confused with Harley Davidson (Sega/Stern Pinball, 1999 and 2002).</p>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Shoot unlit orbits to light them for Advance City, then shoot them again to move forward one city and light them for Million. Advance through all ten cities to light the right saucer for Jackpot. Repeat this, because subsequent jackpots come with an increasing multiplier that can be as high as 10x, awarding you tens of millions of points. Multiball (shoot the left saucer 4 times, then the right saucer once) and the Harley Davidson targets give nice rewards if they happen but should never be the focus of your shotmaking.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>U-S-A top lanes</h3>

<p>Roll through an unlit lane to light it. Use lane change to rotate which lanes are lit; both flippers work, but they both rotate the lights in the same direction. The first five completions of U-S-A over the game score 50,000 points and advance the bonus multiplier up to its maximum of 6x. The sixth completion of U-S-A lights the out lanes alternately for an extra ball. The seventh completion scores 100,000 points, and every completion after that scores 100,000 more points than the previous. If there is a maximum to that bonus, it is at least 500,000 points for the 11th U-S-A completion.<br>Pay attention to the lane change whenever you make an orbit shot that ends up in the top lanes. The bonuses here can be worth a surprising (though not game-breaking) number of points, especially if your copy of the game is keen on giving you up and down action from the left and right bumpers into the U and A lanes.</p>

<h3>Bumpers</h3>

<p>Bumpers score points and increase the jackpot value by 5,000 each. I believe the points they score are also 5,000 each, but it's difficult to tell because the game shows you the jackpot value instead of your score whenever the ball is in the bumpers.</p>

<h3>Orbits and spinners</h3>

<p>Shoot an unlit orbit shot to light it for Advance City. This shot will end up in the top lanes area. If you make a shot to an orbit where Advance City is lit, you will score 50,000 points and move to the next city on the playfield; this ball will come back down the other orbit. At first, you advance through cities from left to right on the playfield: Los Angeles, Salt Lake City, Sturgis, Milwaukee, Chicago, Talledega, Daytona, York, New York City, and Laconia. When you reach Laconia, the right saucer will be lit for Jackpot for 20 seconds. If you collect the jackpot, it will be reset to 5,000,000 points, and the next jackpot's multiplier will be increased. If the ball drains or the jackpot times out, you get nothing, and the next jackpot will have the same multiplier has the current one. Regardless, all cities will then unlight, and you work through them in the opposite direction, with Jackpot being lit again when you return to Los Angeles. Keep criss-crossing the country in this way, collecting jackpots whenever they are lit. </p>

<p>When you shoot an orbit lit for Advance City, that orbit is in turn lit for Million. Shooting it again scores 1,000,000 points, as expected. Advance City and Million lights on orbits both expire after about 10 seconds. If both orbits are lit for Advance City and/or Million, you can get credit for 2 cities or 2,000,000 points, since the ball will go up one orbit and down the other, hitting both switches along the way (if it was a strong enough shot, of course). A weak shot to an orbit may hit the same switch twice, once going up and once going down, which can serve as both lightning and advancing a city in one shot or collecting 2 cities plus 1,000,000 points without the ball going around the back of the game.</p>

<h3>Multiball</h3>

<p>Shoot the left saucer repeatedly to score and advance the lit value: 10,000 (if nothing is lit), then 25,000, then 50,000, then 100,000, then 150,000 and lock ball. Once you lock a ball, the right saucer is also lit for 150,000 and a lock. Locking both balls starts multiball. <br>On the first multiball of the game, some of the left saucer progression may be spotted for you (default settings have it so the first saucer shot scores the 50,000). On hard settings, though, there may be timers in place for one or more steps of the left saucer progression, with the saucer levelling down or completely timing out if you take too long to hit it again.</p>

<p>During multiball, pretty much everything is in play: you can still advance cities and collect Jackpots. You cannot relock balls toward another multiball start until single ball play resumes. There is one multiball-specific scoring feature: when Multiball starts, all of the Harley-Davidson drop targets and standup targets reset their progress, and if you spell the entirety of Harley-Davidson during multiball, you receive 5,000,000 points, which can be collected more than once. Don't go out of your way for this unless you're close to it, but the chaos of multiball will probably get you close to it sooner than you may expect.</p>

<h3>Harley and Davidson targets</h3>

<p>Completing the H-A-R drop targets on the left lights the left spinner for 3,000 points per spin for one rip. The L-E-Y targets do the same for the right spinner. Completing all of Harley scores and advances the Harley Bonus in the order of 25,000 (if not lit) - 50,000 - 100,000 - 200,000 - 300,000 - 500,000. The 500,000 can be collected multiple times until 30 seconds pass without a Harley Bonus, in which case the value resets to 25,000.</p>

<p>Completing the Davidson standup targets (D in the lower left, A in the upper left, V in the upper right, IDSON on the right wall) starts a Speed Trap hurry-up collectible at the right saucer. The first Speed Trap starts at 1,000,000 and counts down to 100,000 over 20 seconds. Collecting the Speed Trap at any value increases the starting value of the next Speed Trap by 1,000,000 points, with no limit that I'm aware of. Completing Davidson twice in one ball lights the right saucer for an extra ball.</p>

<h3>Right side speed trap hole</h3>

<p>This is a hidden saucer in the lower right that cannot be shot for directly. If the ball ends up here, you get the Speed Trap mystery, which can be any of the following: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Points: 50,000 or 100,000, maybe others?</li>
	<li>Advance City</li>
	<li>Speeding Ticket: either nothing or -10,000 points depending on settings</li>
	<li>Warning: absolutely nothing</li>
	<li>Score Harley Bonus</li>
	<li>Score Bike Bonus</li>
	<li>Light Speed Bonus hurry-up</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>The in lanes and out lanes are reversed on Harley Davidson, with the in lanes being closer to the edges of the table and the out lanes being closer to the slingshots. With good nudging, a ball in the out lanes can be nudged back toward the flippers off of one of the corners of the reversed structure, but a ball in the in lane may also choke up and fall into the out lanes.</p>

<p>The in lanes and out lanes spell Bike. Rolling through an unlit lane lights it. Lane change with either flipper rotates which lanes are lit. Compelting Bike spots the next city in line and scores the Bike Bonus, which is 250,000 the first time, then 500,000, then 750,000, then 1,000,000 thereafter.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is advanced by...stuff. Presumably spinners, bumpers, and targets, though I don't know for sure. Base bonus seems to be in 1,000 point increments and maxes out at 250,000. Bonus multiplier is incremented with each top lanes completion toward the max of 6x. After the base bonus times multiplier is added, you receive 10,000 points per city travelled to on the current trip across the country. By default, bonus multiplier is carried over, but base bonus is not. There is no mid-ball bonus collect. </p>

<p>A common bug on this game causes the Instant Info/status report to show the current Bonus Multiplier as NULL. This seems to happen most often after the 6th U-S-A completion, which lights the out lane extra balls. Do not be concerned by this; the bonus multiplier shown by the lit inserts on the table is correct and will still be applied.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>The manual indicates the specials score 1,000,000 points in competition/novelty play, but I am not aware of a place to earn a special outright in this game. There is no point value that can be assigned to extra balls. A game setting determines whether extra balls are open ended or limited to one per ball in play.</p>

<p>There are 9 difficulty settings for starting multiball; any of the 4 shots can be spotted for you, and any of the 4 shots can be on a timer of between 5 and 30 seconds before unlighting.</p>

<p>The max jackpot multiplier can be set to anywhere from 1 to 10. Default is the full 10. Since this game rolls the score at 100,000,000 points, jackpots of 4x or more that guarantee 20,000,000+ points are slightly absurd.</p>

<p>The timers for Advance City lit (10-99 seconds, default 15) and Million orbits (5-60 seconds, default 7) can be adjusted. The left and right orbits can have different timers on the Advance City and Million lights.</p>

<p>The first Speed hurry-up can have any value from 1,000,000 to 5,000,000. It will still continue to rise by 1,000,000 after each collect. The time on the hurry-up can be set to between 15-60 seconds, default 20.</p>

<p>The Harley Bonus can be set to start at any of the lit values at the beginning of the game. The time limit to recollect the 500,000 Harley bonus can be set to between 5 and 60 seconds (default 30).</p>

<p>The Bike value can be reset between balls instead of carrying over across the game.</p>

<p>You can start the game at any of the first 6 cities: LA, Salt Lake, Sturgis, Milwaukee, or Chicago.</p>

<p>Base bonus and bonus multiplier can both be carried over from ball to ball. By default, base bonus is not carried, but multiplier is.</p>
