<h1 style="color:red;">Fireball II (Bally, 1981)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Try to always stay in multiball. Completing the green arrow targets with the upper flipper will light a lock if no balls are already locked, or start multiball if a ball has been locked. There are two bonuses: Fireball Bonus is advanced by A-B-C-D lanes or left drop targets and can only be collected at saucers lit orange. Doomsday Bonus is a conventional end of ball bonus built with the center or right drop targets. Note that the center post is a player-operated kickback with the second button on the side of the cabinet.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>A-B-C-D letters</h3>

<p>A and B are the table's top lanes, while C and D are the in lanes. Lit lanes score 5,000 points and unlight the lane; unlit lanes score 500. Any A-B-C-D lane, whether lit or not, advances the Fireball Bonus. Collecting both the A and B will light one of the top lanes of the table for 10,000 points, alternating with bumper and slingshot hits. Completing A-B-C-D restores the lights for all four lanes and increases the Fireball Bonus multiplier, up to a maximum of 5x.</p>

<h3>Pop bumpers</h3>

<p>Score 100 points, or 1,000 when flashing. Each completion of the center drop targets causes one additional bumper to flash for the rest of the ball.</p>

<h3>Top left green arrow targets</h3>

<p>Hitting one of the green arrow targets, likely with the upper left flipper, lights that target. Lighting all 3 targets will light one of the lock saucers if no balls have been locked, or release any locked balls if one or more locks have been made. These targets will not light at all when hit if both locks are available but neither has been used. Once a ball is released from a lock, another completion of the arrow targets is required to re-qualify that saucer for a lock again. Completing the arrow bank when both saucers contain a locked ball- thus releasing both at once for an instant 3-ball multiball- lights the arrow target to award a Special with the next completion. </p>

<h3>Lock saucers</h3>

<p>Odin's Lair, on the left, is effectively an orbit shot, with the ball need to travel to the back left of the game and roll along the wall for the ball to land in the saucer. It kicks out to the right, through a one way gate to the top lanes. Wotan's Lair, on the right, is a direct shot with the lower left flipper. Wotan's saucer is at the end of a deceptively wide lane, make it possible for even a well-shot ball to roll around and rim out. </p>

<p>Making any saucer scores 5,000 points. If neither saucer is lit for a lock, one of them will be lit orange for Collect Fireball Bonus, with the orange light alternating with bumper and slingshot hits. If exactly one saucer has been lit for a lock, the other one will be solidly lit for Collect Fireball Bonus. If both saucers have been lit for a lock, neither will be available for Collect Fireball Bonus, and a multiball must be started to make that feature available again. In short, a saucer cannot be lit for both a lock and Collect Fireball Bonus at the same time. Shooting the ball into any saucer at any time scores 5,000 points.</p>

<p>Saucers are lit for a lock one at a time by completing the upper left standup targets when no balls are locked. Any locked balls are released if locks have been made when the upper left targets are completed. The upper left targets can be completed additional times, and balls re-locked in the saucers, during a multiball. Doing so will feed a new ball to the shooter lane mid-multiball.</p>

<h3>Left drop target 4-bank</h3>

<p>Each target down in this bank scores 3,000 points and increases the Fireball Bonus. Completing this bank scores and advances the lit drop target value.</p>

<h3>Center drop target 3-bank</h3>

<p>Each target down scores 300 points and advances the Doomsday Bonus. Completing this bank advances the multiplier on the Doomsday Bonus. At seemingly random intervals throughout the game, this bank will be lit very briefly for an extra ball, which is awarded if the bank is completed while the extra ball lamp is lit. A ringing sound effect accompanies this opportunity. I have not determined exactly what lights this extra ball, but it's on for a short enough time that the extra ball is basically impossible to earn if all 3 targets are still standing when the opportunity for the extra ball arises.</p>

<h3>Right drop target 4-bank</h3>

<p>Each target down in this bank scores 3,000 points and advances the Doomsday Bonus. Completing this bank scores and advances the lit drop target value.</p>

<h3>Drop target value</h3>

<p>The inserts just above the Fireball Bonus wheel represent the drop target value. This only applies to completions of the left and right banks; the center drop target bank does not socre this value, and the extra ball insert is not actually part of the progression of the drop target value. Completing either the left or right drop target banks scores and advances this value, which can be depicted by multiple lights being on at once: the sequence is 15,000 - 30,000 - 50,000 - 65,000 - 95,000 - special. If none of the inserts are lit, clearing either bank of drop targets scores 5,000 points and lights the 15,000 insert. </p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>The Fireball Bonus is advanced by going through any A-B-C-D lane or hitting any left drop target. The Fireball Bonus multiplier is advanced by collecting all 4 of A-B-C-D. The maximum base Fireball bonus can be set to either 12,000 or 23,000 points. Max Fireball Bonus multiplier is 5x. Fireball Bonus can only be collected by shooting one of the lock saucers when it is lit orange for Collect Fireball Bonus.</p>

<p>Doomsday Bonus is advanced by hitting any center drop target or right drop target. Completing the center bank of drop targets increases the Doomsday Bonus multiplier. The Doomsday Bonus maxes out at 39,000 points, and the multiplier maxes at 4x. Doomsday Bonus and the corresponding multiplier are only collected when the ball drains. If the Doomsday Bonus base value is maxed out at 39,000 one time, both out lanes will light for a special. If the Doomsday Bonus base value is maxed out at 39,000 a second time, hitting one more center or right drop target will award a special instantly.</p>

<p>Neither the value nor the multiplier on either of the game's two bonuses can be carried over from ball to ball.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table and Little Demon</h3>

<p>Fireball II has in lanes and out lanes, but they are not parallel to each other. Instead, the in lanes are angled toward the edge of the table. The ball must bounce off a post just above the out lane to pass through a one-way gate and end up in the in lane. The in lanes score 500 points or 5,000 when lit, and are the only way to collect the letters C and D. The out lanes score 1,000 points and can be lit for a special after maxing out the Doomsday Bonus base value at 39,000 points one time.</p>

<p>In between the flippers is a center peg called the Little Demon. It is actually player-operated! The second button on the right side of the cabinet causes the post to lurch forward, acting as one more chance to save a ball going between the flippers. At the beginning of the game, each player is given 5 uses of the Little Demon. 2 additional uses are awarded for each completion of the center drop target bank. At the end of the game, 10,000 points are given for each unused charge of the Little Demon saver.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>In competition/novelty play, specials score 50,000 points and extra balls score 25,000.</p>

<p>The Fireball Bonus can be set to have its base value max out at 12,000 or 23,000 points. Also, it can be set to be collected when the ball drains alongside the Doomsday Bonus, instead of only being able to be collected at a saucer that is lit orange. </p>

<p>The C and D on the in lanes can be set to be tied together, so that collecting either one gives credit for both.</p>

<p>Fireball Bonus multiplier, lit locks, progress on the green arrow targets, and progress on A-B-C-D can each individually be reset or carried over from ball to ball.</p>
