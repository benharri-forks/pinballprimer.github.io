<h1>Playboy (Bally, 1978)</h1>

<p>Not to be confused with Playboy 35th Anniversary (Data East, 1989) or Playboy (Stern Pinball, 2002)</p>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Collect sets of 5 keys to advance the bonus multiplier, which always carries forward from ball to ball. After collecting all 5 keys within a single ball, focus on getting the ball into the upper left Grotto hole via nudging and pop bumper luck or via a particularly strong right orbit shot. The drop targets light the out lanes for 25,000 points the first time, and score a special the second time. The standup targets light the star rollover for extra ball the first time, and special the second time.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Keys</h3>

<p>There are 5 keys: 1-4 are the top lanes, and the 5 is a standup target in the dead center of the playfield. Hitting a lit key lane or target unlights that number and collects it, scoring 500 points and a bonus advance. The first three completions of the 5 keys award 2x, 3x, and 5x bonus. Each completion starting with the 4th awards a special. Bonus multiplier (i.e. completed key sets) always carries over from ball to ball, but whether partial progress on a set of keys is held over from ball to ball is determined by an in game setting.</p>

<p>The 2 and 3 keys can be tied together, so that collecting either one gives credit for both. The 1 and 4 keys can be tied together in the same way as well.</p>

<h3>Playboy Grotto</h3>

<p>Collecting a key at any time during a ball lights the corresponding number in the Playboy Grotto lane. When the ball ends up in this lane, it scores 1,000 points and a bonus advance for each lit number, plus an additional 25,000 point bonus if all 5 numbers are lit. This can mean that without much effort, this lane scores 30,000 points and 5 bonus advance per hit, making it the most lucrative source of points in the game. Being a kickback lane, the ball will be launched upward after the score is done counting, giving the player another shot at a 1-4 key from the top lanes.</p>

<h3>Drop targets</h3>

<p>Each target down scores 500 points. Completing the bank once lights the out lanes for 25,000 points. Completing the bank a second time scores a special.</p>

<h3>Left "Playmate" standup targets and star rollover</h3>

<p>Unlit targets score 500 points, and light up when hit. Lit targets score a bonus advance in addition to the 500 points. Lighting all 5 targets once lights the star rollover just above the targets for an extra ball; completing the set a second time lights that star rollover for a special. The star rollover also always scores 5,000 points in addition to any lit awards.</p>

<h3>Right orbit</h3>

<p>The right orbit scores 500 points or 5,000 when lit and advances bonus. Key lanes/targets, drop targets, standup targets, and in lanes alternate whether or not the orbit shot is lit.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Playboy has a conventional in/out lane setup. In lanes always score 500 points. Out lanes score 1,000 points, or 25,000 when lit after one completion of the drop targets.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Key lanes/targets, the right orbit switch, and lit Playmate standup targets each award 1 bonus advance. The Playboy Grotto awards 1 bonus advance for each number lit when the shot is made, for a maximum of 5 bonus advances. Max bonus is 39,000 points. Bonus is not carried over from ball to ball unless it is advanced to the Super Bonus level of 20,000; after that, the bonus will only reset down to 20,000 at the beginning of each ball instead of 1,000. <br>Bonus multipliers are collected from sets of the 1-5 keys: 2x the first time, 3x the second time, and 5x the third time. Bonus multipliers are always carried from ball to ball, but incomplete sets of keys may or may not be reset. Max bonus award is 5x 39,000 = 195,000 points. Because the Super Bonus and the bonus X carryover cannot be turned off, Playboy disproportionately awards players for having a good ball 1 so that they can guarantee themselves good rewards on subsequent balls.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>The 1 and 4 keys can be tied together, so that collecting one gives credit for both. The 2 and 3 keys can be tied together in the same way.</p>

<p>Completing the drop targets can cause just one of the two out lanes to light for 25,000, alternating with certain switch hits, instead of both out lanes.</p>

<p>Lit extra balls, lit specials, and key sets in progress can all individually be set to carry over between balls or not.</p>
