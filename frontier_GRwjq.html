<h1 style="color:blue;">Frontier (Bally, 1980)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Clear the left inline drop targets, then focus on the right orbit/lit spinner all day, nudging into the open Frontier Bonus saucer or whichever A-B-C lanes you need at the top of the playfield. The right drop targets are your bonus multiplier, but since base bonus carries from ball to ball, wait to focus on this until bonus is very high (the grid of animals has been completed once, minimum).</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>A-B-C top lanes</h3>

<p>Rolling through a lane at any time scores 5,000 points, adds an animal to the corresponding column (left, center, or right), and lights the corresponding bumper (left, bottom/center, or right). Rolling through a lane lit for A-B-C also unlights that lane. There is no flipper lane change available to rotate which lanes are lit, so skill and nudging are needed to complete sets of A-B-C. The first completion of A-B-C lights one of the in lanes alternately for 15,000 points. The second completion of A-B-C scores an instant extra ball. The third and all subsequent completions of A-B-C award an instant special.<br>Going through an A-B-C lane when the respective column is full does not award any bonus points in the way that the standup targets do.</p>

<h3>Frontier Bonus collect</h3>

<p>At the top of the table and just to the right of the C lane is another small lane. It is initially closed off and opens only after hitting one of the inline drop targets or the back grizzly bear target in the left lane. When the gate is open, an orange arrow is lit. It takes a lucky bounce or good nudging after a right orbit spinner shot to get the ball in this lane. Making this lane scores the Frontier Bonus with multiplier as shown on the playfield; more on this in the Animal grid section below. The Frontier Bonus collect saucer can also be accessed via pop bumper luck through a very small gap in the railing to the right of the rightmost pop bumper.</p>

<h3>Left lane and inline drop targets</h3>

<p>The first inline target scores 5,000 points and lights the right spinner. The second inline target scores 10,000 points and increases the Frontier bonus multiplier to 2x. The third inline target scores 15,000 points and increases the Frontier bonus multiplier to 3x. The standup target at the end of the lane is the Grizzly bear target, which scores a repeatable 30,000 points, and also maxes out the Frontier bonus multiplier at 4x the first time.<br>Always make it a priority to hit at least the first target to light the spinner at the start of each ball, and if the Frontier Bonus is at considerable value (60,000 or more), try to at least complete all three targets as well.<br>A strong hit to the inline drop targets should come back to the right flipper, where it can be caught or deadbounced over to the left. However, sometimes, a hit to an inline target can deflect the ball directly between the flippers, or close to it. Know that a slap save may be required to stay alive after a shot to the left side.</p>

<h3>Animal grid and Frontier Bonus</h3>

<p>The three top lanes each score 5,000 points and add one animal to the left, center, or right columns of the grid respectively. The three standup targets around the center of the table also each add to the corresponding animal column (as well as scoring 500 points). Each lit animal in the grid is worth 3,000 points in base bonus. Completing a horizontal line in the grid by adding an animal to each column once increases the base Frontier Bonus by 10,000 points. If a column of the grid is full of 5 lit animals, that column's standup target on the playfield will score 15,000 points per hit until the entire grid is finished. After completing the entire grid once, all animals will unlight; the 45,000 super bonus turns on, so the bonus can be built further; and the Frontier Bonus will now include a special since it has reached 60,000 points. The base Frontier Bonus will max out at either 60,000 or 110,000 based on game settings. There are no bonuses for animals past the 45,000 super bonus, so the base bonus count will actually decrease from 87,000 to 45,000 upon completion of the second, third, etc., grid of animals. </p>

<h3>Right spinner</h3>

<p>Scores 10 points per spin, or 1,000/spin when lit by knocking down the first inline drop target on the left. Probably the most important shot in the game to find, since the lit spinner is good value on its own and it sends the ball to the top of the table for safe collection of more animals.</p>

<h3>Right drop targets</h3>

<p>Each target down scores 500 points. The first three completions of this target bank advance the Animals bonus to 2x, then 3x, then 4x. The Animals bonus applies to the 3,000 per lit animal in the grid and the 45,000 super bonus that is lit after one grid completion. Achieving 4x Animals bonus lights the out lanes alternately for a special, and any further completions of the drop targets themselves also score a special.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Frontier has a conventional in/out lane setup. The out lanes score 1,000 points and are lit alternately for special after 3 completions of the right side drop targets. The in lanes score 500 points or 15,000 when lit, and they are lit alternately after completing the A-B-C top lanes once. "Alternately lit" lanes toggle with any bumper or slingshot hit.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>The Frontier bonus is 10,000 points, plus an additional 10,000 for each horizontal row of grid animals completed throughout the game so far, up to a maximum of 60,000 or 110,000 points based on game settings. The Frontier bonus multiplier can be 2x, 3x, or 4x, earnable at the second inline drop target, the third inline drop target, and the Grizzly bear standup target respectively. This bonus can always be collected at the saucer in the top right of the table. By default, the Frontier bonus is <i>not</i> added to the end of ball bonus, but a setting exists so that it can be.</p>

<p>The Animals bonus is 3,000 points for each currently lit animal in the grid, plus an additional 45,000 points if the grid has been completed at least once during the game. 2x, 3x, and 4x multipliers of the Animals bonus are available from 1, 2, or 3 completions of the right side drop targets. The Animals bonus with multiplier is always given in end of ball bonus, and there is no way to collect it mid-ball. The maximum base bonus here is 87,000 points, which is available by completing the entire grid once and then draining with 14 of the 15 animals lit toward an additional completion.</p>

<p>Base bonus counts for both Frontier and Animals bonus are both always carried forward throughout the game, but all multipliers for both bonuses are reset between balls. There is no way to change either of these rules within the game settings.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>In competition/novelty play, specials score 50,000 points and extra balls score 25,000. If the game is set to Extra Ball Only mode and an extra ball or special is earned while Same Player Shoots Again is already lit, the above point values apply then as well.</p>

<p>The A and C lanes can be tied together, so that rolling through either one when lit gives credit for both. The A-B-C extra ball can be lit at the start of the game, menaing just one completion is needed to earn an extra ball, and specials are awarded for all completions starting with the second. Finally, the status of the A-B-C lights in progress can be held in memory from ball to ball. By default, none of these things are true.</p>

<p>The 15,000 point in lanes and the specials lit on the out lanes can each be set to light on both sides at once rather than alternate.</p>

<p>The Frontier bonus can be set to max out at 60,000 points or 110,000. The Frontier bonus can also be allowed to be collected during the end-of-ball bonus.</p>

<p>The out lane specials can be set to light after 2 completions of the right side drop targets instead of 3.</p>
