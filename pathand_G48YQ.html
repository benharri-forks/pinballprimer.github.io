<h1 style="color:pink;">Pat Hand / Satin Doll (Williams, 1975)</h1>

<p>Pat Hand is the 4 player version. Satin Doll is the 2 player version. Aside from two minor layout/rules changes, the two games have identical scoring. This guide focuses on Pat Hand, with differences in Satin Doll mentioned at the end of the page.</p>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>First priority on any ball is to build the bonus up to the maximum of 10,000 using the left rollover buttons. From there, complete the 10-Ace/1-5 rollover buttons in the center twice to light double bonus, then shoot up to the top of the table to collect 1,000 point rollover buttons. Ignore the right side targets unless extra balls are on, and ignore the top standup targets no matter what.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top rollover buttons</h3>

<p>Score 100 points, or 1,000 when lit. They are all lit by completing the 10-Ace buttons in the center of the playfield once. These are the best source of points in the game after bonus has been maxed out.</p>

<h3>Left rollover buttons</h3>

<p>When not lit, each button scores 10 points and advances the bonus. When lit, each button just scores 100 points. These buttons are only lit once the base bonus is maxed out at 10,000 points. A ball that goes down the left side of the upper triangle structure should hit a few of these buttons, and there's also a rather satisfying shot from the right flipper that picks all of them off in a orbit-esque shot.</p>

<h3>Top standup targets</h3>

<p>There are 5 targets. Unlit targets score 50 points. The single lit target scores 3,000 points. If the center 10-Ace rollovers have been completed 3 times on the current ball, the lit target also scores a special. Which target is lit will rotate every time the 100 point switch is activated. Do not be tempted by the 3,000 points and a special. These targets are death. Do not shoot for them. It is not worth it. It is always safer to shoot to either side of this target bank and try to collect top rollover buttons, even if those buttons are not lit. These targets are not even optimal as the ends to the means of collecting 10-Ace rollovers: use the upper flipper to collect those instead for more consistency. </p>

<h3>Right standup Joker targets</h3>

<p>Always score 1,000 points. Hitting an unlit target lights it. Lighting all 4 targets awards an extra ball.</p>

<h3>Center 10-Ace rollover buttons</h3>

<p>The goal of these buttons is to unlight them, not light them. Buttons score 10 points, and triggering a lit button unlights it. Knocking out all 5 of these buttons once lights the top rollover buttons for 1,000 points each and also lights the bumpers for 100 points. A second completion of these buttons awards 2x bonus multiplier, and a third completion lights the specials at the top target bank and the right in lane.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>On the left side of the table bottom, there is no in or out lane. Instead, the playfield is just wide open to the flipper, with a pair of vertically aligned pop bumpers taking the place of a slingshot. The bumpers score 10 points when not lit or 100 when lit, and are lit by completing 10-Ace once. When the ball is anywhere near the lower of these two bumpers, hold the left flipper up to defend against the bumpers dunking the ball down the middle.<br>The right side of the table bottom is conventional in/out lanes. The in lane scores a measly 10 points, and is lit for a special after 3 completions of 10-Ace. The out lane always scores 1,000 points.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Each ball starts with 1,000 points in base bonus. Left rollover buttons increase the bonus up to a maximum of 10,000 points. Completing the 10-Ace center rollovers twice lights double bonus. Base bonus and bonus multiplier cannot be carried over from ball to ball, so it's important at the beginning of each ball to try to fill up the bonus as much as possible.</p>

<h3>Differences in Satin Doll</h3>

<p>On Satin Doll, the left rollover buttons score 100 points and a bonus advance when not lit, or 1,000 points when lit, making them even more lucrative as a shot late in a ball.</p>

<p>Also, on Satin Doll, the conventional in/out lane structure on the right side of the table bottom is replaced by a two-flipper layout with no in lane. The ball can drain between the two flippers. The out lane still always scores 1,000 points. Since there is no in lane, the only special available on Satin Doll is from the light top standup targets after 3 completions of the center 1-5 rollovers.</p>

<p>For clarity, the 10-Ace center rollovers on Pat Hand are the same as the 1-5 center rollovers on Satin Doll.</p>
