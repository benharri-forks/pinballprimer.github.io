<h1 style="color:pink;">Joker Poker (Gottlieb, 1978)</h1>

<p>Not to be confused with Williams' Jokerz! or any of the numerous games simply called Joker.</p>

<p>This game had both solid state and electromechanical versions. This guide was written with the solid state version in mind. Note that the EM version may have slightly different scoring or rules.</p>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Complete banks of drop targets to light bonus values. One bank is spotted at the beginning of the ball; complete that bank to light 5X bonus. Individual drop targets are worth 5,000 points each in lit banks, and banks reset when finished, so decent points are available by just clearing the Queen or King banks repeatedly.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Drop targets and bonus ladder</h3>
<p>Each bank of drop targets corresponds to one entry on the bonus ladder; complete that bank to light that bonus. <br>The Queen, King, and Ace banks immediately reset when completed; the 10 and Jack banks need to both be completed before both will reset. </p>
<p>One bank completion will be spotted (lit) for you on each ball. In a three ball game, you will be spotted the 10 on ball 1, the Queens on ball 2, and the Aces on ball 3. In a 5 ball game, the banks will be spotted in order on balls 1 through 5. Completing the bank that was spotted for you lights 5X bonus. <br>Each individual drop is worth 500 points, or 5,000 points if it is part of a bank that has already been spotted or completed. An additional 5,000 points is awarded for completing a bank.</p>
<p>Completing the Ace bank in the top left lights the upper right standup target for extra ball and the upper right side lane for special. EB and Special have no value in competition play, but are not too hard to hit if lit in casual play. Notice that there's an upper right flipper to assist with finishinf the Ace targets.</p>
<p>It can be a reasonable strategy to repeatedly complete a bank to take advantage of the drops being worth 5,000 each. On paper, it's best to do this with the Queens, since Jacks require the 10 to be hit in order to reset and all other banks are considerably harder to complete. Especially if the flippers are particularly strong or the table angle is particularly high, it's best to make sure the ball covers as little ground as possible. </p>

<h3>A-B-C lanes</h3>
<p>A-B-C rollovers give 5,000 points when lit, at which point they unlight and are then worth just 500 points. In addition to the A-B-C lanes at the top right of the playfield, the B can be awarded from either in lane, and A & C can be awarded on the out lanes. Completing A-B-C lights the extra ball at the top right standup and the special at the upper right side lane, just like competing the Ace bank. Only one extra ball and one special can be earned per ball in play. In competition play, this isn't worth anything beyond the 15,000 points from the letters themselves. Progression on A-B-C resets between balls.</p>
