<h1 style="color:lime;">Elvira and the Party Monsters (Bally Williams, 1989)</h1>

<p>Not to be confused with the other games starring Elvira, Mistress of the Dark: Scared Stiff (Bally Williams, 1996) and Elvira's House of Horrors (Stern Pinball, 2019).</p>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Elvira's first pinball table is brutally difficult, with monstrously hungry out lanes and three major shots all designed to center drain you if you don't hit them exactly right. Lock balls at the left orbit; 3 locks starts multiball. If the orbit is not lit for a lock, complete the Bat top lanes or the Jam center drop targets to light it. During multiball, hit one ramp within 15 seconds of the other (either order) to score a jackpot worth up to 4,000,000. Completing Bat, Jam, or all 4 Wake the Dead Heads targets in the lower left lights the left ramp for an Elvira letter: spell Elvira to light the lock shot for 3,000,000 for 20 seconds. Combo the left ramp for a chance at a 1,000,000 shot; combo the right ramp for extra balls.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Bat top lanes</h3>

<p>Roll through a lane to light it. Lit lanes can be rotated with either flipper lane change, but both flippers move the lights in the same direction. Spell Bat to advance the bonus multiplier toward its maximum of 5x, light the left orbit for Lock if it was not already, and light the left ramp for an Elvira letter.</p>

<h3>Left ramp</h3>

<p>The first shot up the ramp scores 50,000 points and starts a 15-second timer. Subsequent ramp shots score 25,000 more points than the previous, and reset the timer. After 2 ramp shots, the center saucer will be lit for Hold Bonus. After 4 ramp shots, the next step in the sequence will be a 1,000,000 point shot. If you collect the Million, there will be one more step required in the next left ramp combo before the 1,000,000 is available the next time. If you continue the left ramp combo after getting the Million shot, further ramps will each award 250,000 points and an Elvira letter until the combo breaks. </p>

<p>This ramp is also lit for an Elvira letter immediately after completing the Bat top lanes, the Jam drop targets, or the Wake the Dead Hears lower left targets.</p>

<h3>Right ramp</h3>

<p>The right ramp's value starts at 175,000 points. Making the ramp scores the value and advances it by 25,000 points. A right ramp worth 250,000 points also awards an extra ball. After the first extra ball, the ramp value will reset to 100,000, and must be built up again for the next extra ball. After the second (or beyond) extra ball, the ramp value will reset to 10,000 (hitting it once increases it to 25,000). Also, progress toward the extra ball persists from ball to ball until you get the first extra ball, but after that, the ramp progress will reset between balls.</p>

<h3>Locks and multiball</h3>

<p>Lock balls at the left orbit when lit. If the left orbit is not lit, complete the Bat top lanes or the Jam drop targets to light it. Lock 3 balls to start multiball. Your one and only goal in multiball is to hit the two ramps within about 10 seconds of each other to score the Jackpot. If the jackpot is set to progressive, it will start at 1,000,000 points, increase by any non-ramp scoring made during multiball up to 4,000,000, and reset to 1,000,000 when collected. If the jackpot is set to static, it will always be worth the max value of 4,000,000. Only one jackpot can be collected during a multiball; after that, any and all ramp shots score 250,000 points until multiball ends.<br>If, at any time during the multiball, you put two balls up the left ramp at the same time, you score a 500,000 point bonus. </p>

<h3>The Barbeque</h3>

<p>Hit the two Barbeque targets to the right of the left ramp to light the center saucer for Barbeque Bonus. Barbeque Bonus is a mystery award that can give anywhere from 50,000 to 200,000 points, or a bonus multiplier, or an Elvira letter, or an extra ball.</p>

<h3>Boogie Bonus</h3>

<p>Complete the Jam drop targets to light the center saucer for Boogie Bonus. The Boogie Bonus starts at 25,000 points: it increases by 1,000 for each bumper hit, and 10,000 for each additional completion of the Jam targets, until it is collected.</p>

<h3>Lower left standup targets</h3>

<p>Hit all 4 targets to light the phrase Wake The Dead Heads. The first completion on a ball scores 20,000 points and lights the left in lane for 25,000 points. Subsequent completions score 40,000, then 50,000 and light the center saucer for 1,000,000, then 60,000, then 70,000, then 80,000 and light special alternately on the out lanes, then a repeatable 200,000 for the rest of the ball. These targets are very dangerous to shoot for on some machines due to their tendency to drop the ball on the top of the left slingshot, where it can bounce into the out lane.</p>

<h3>Lower right standup targets and right orbit</h3>

<p>Hitting Gravestone and Pizza scores 20,000 the first time and an additional 20,000 each subsequent time during the game, up to a maximum of 200,000 points. Any completion also lights the right in lane for 25,000 points for the rest of the ball. Each completion of Gravestone Pizza adds one light to the right orbit. The right orbit scores 50,000 per lit arrow (or 25,000 if none are lit); collecting the value unlights all arrows.</p>

<h3>Elvira letters</h3>

<p>Completing the Bat top lanes, Jam drop targets, or Wake the Dead Heads targets lights the left ramp for an Elvira letter. You can also get Elvira letters from the Barbeque Bonus or from additional shots in a left ramp combo after the 1,000,000 shot. Spelling Elvira lights the lock shot for 3,000,000 points for 20 seconds. If you fail, the letters R and A unlight and must be recollected for another shot. By default, Elvira letters carry over from ball to ball and from game to game.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Elvira and the Party Monsters has a conventional in/out lane setup. Out lanes score 40,000 points and 3 bonus advances, or can be lit for special by completing Wake the Dead Heads six times in one ball. In lanes score 5,000 points when not lit or 25,000 when lit, plus a bonus advance; light the left and right in lanes respectively by completing Wake the Dead Heads or Gravestone Pizza once.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Top lanes, in lanes, and Jam drop targets award 1 bonus advance each. Out lanes, Elvira letters, and completing Jam or Wake the Dead Heads is worth 3 bonus advances. Max base bonus is 99,000 points. Bonus multipliers are earned from completing the Bat top lanes or from the Barbeque Bonus. Max bonus multiplier is 5x. There is no mid-ball bonus collect. Multipliers can never be carried from ball to ball. Base bonus can only be carried to the next ball by making two consecutive left ramp shots to light Hold Bonus, then collecting it at the center saucer.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>In competition/novelty play, specials are worth 100,000 points. Extra balls cannot be set to have a point value.</p>

<p>The left ramp timer can be anywhere from 3 to 20 seconds (default 15); the number of left ramp shots needed for the first 1,000,000 can be set from 5 to 11 (default 5); the number of left ramps needed to light Hold Bonus can be 1 to 6 (default 2); the timer for which the ramp is lit for an Elvira letter can be 5 to 20 seconds (default 15).</p>

<p>The first right ramp extra ball can be at anywhere from 3 to 12 ramps, default 4.</p>

<p>The multiball jackpot can either always be set to 4,000,000, or be a progressive jackpot that starts at 1,000,000 and builds across games whenever a multiball is played.</p>

<p>Any number of letters from 0 to 5 can be instantly restored after letting the 3,000,000 shot time out. Default is 4.</p>

<p>Elvira letters can carry over across games (default), only across balls within the same game, or be separate for each player.</p>
