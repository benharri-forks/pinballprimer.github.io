<h1>Maverick: The Movie (Data East / Sega, 1994)</h1>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Complete the flashing drop target bank(s) to win hands and earn poker chips. Hitting drop targets not part of the flashing banks reduces your Discard count, and running out of discards loses the hand. Collecting 5 poker chips starts a mode. Shoot orbits to light the ramp for a mystery award, which can most notably light Mega Pops or 20x Bonus. Shoot the right ramp to light locks, then the left orbit to lock balls; three jackpots are at the right ramp, then the super jackpot is at the captive ball underneath the boat toy and behind the upper left drop targets.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Skill shot</h3>

<p>The skill shot is a precise-power plunge with 5 possible outcomes. <br>The DMD will show what awards are available at the first three holes, labelled 1, 2, and 3. Hole 1 is almost always Light Lock; hole 2 is almost always Start Mode; hole 3 is usually Super Pops (bumpers worth 2,000,000 for the entire current ball), but will sometimes be Light Extra Ball or Light Special as a consolation award on the game's final ball. Once one of the three awards is collected, it cannot be recollected until all three have been earned; making an unlit 1-2-3 hole scores 5,000,000 points only. <br>A shot that goes just beyond the #3 hole will fall into a 4th hole that drops the ball into the right orbit. This is the flipper skill shot option; use the upper right flipper to shoot across the playfield at the captive ball under the boat to start Drop Poker, a 20-second mode where all drop targets score increasing millions.<br>Option 5 is a full plunge, which follows the squiggly habitrail to the right in lane, scoring whatever is currently available on the right ramp.</p>

<h3>Drop targets: Poker hands</h3>

<p>At the start of a ball, the game will assign you a poker hand to complete. This could be one of 6 options:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Pair of Deuces: the standup targets on either side of the right ramp entrance</li>
	<li>Three of a Kind: center drop target 3-bank. This will usually be the first bank you are given</li>
	<li>Full House: both the Pair of Deuces and the Three of a Kind</li>
	<li>Four of a Kind: the lower right drop target 4-bank</li>
	<li>Straight: the upper left drop target 5-bank along the side of the boat toy</li>
	<li>Royal Flush: the lower left drop target 5-bank</li>
</ul>
<p>Completing the assigned poker hand increases your Winning Streak by 1, scores 5,000,000 points times your current Winning Streak, and awards one poker chip. Hitting any playing card target that is not part of your assigned hand will cost one Discard. Each ball starts with 12 Discards, minus the current length of your Winning Streak. If you run out of Discards, the hand is lost and your Winning Streak is reset. Drop targets that were hit for a discard will stay down and cannot penalize you again, but the Pair of Deuces standup targets can cause multiple discards on the same hand. The game will try not to take away a discard if it has a reason to; incorrect drop targets hit after a ricochet off of a correct target are never penalized, and you will sometimes not get penalized for a drop target hit immediately after a slingshot as well.<br>The first shot to the up-kicker at the top of the table after starting a hand will allow you to Raise or Fold. If you Raise, the current hand will be worth two poker chips and double points if it is won, and the Winning Streak will go up by 2. If you Fold, the drop targets will reset and a new hand will be given, but your Winning Streak will not be reset. If you complete a poker hand without using <i>any</i> discards, the point value of that hand will be tripled to 15,000,000 times your Winning Streak alongside the poker chip. Completing a poker hand with exactly 1 discard remaining scores a Close Call, which doubles the point value to 10,000,000 times the Winning Streak alongside the poker chip. Raising a hand to double the award can be stacked with a Perfect or Close Call completion. Collecting 5 poker chips starts the currently flashing mode, which is rotated with each pop bumper hit.</p>

<p>The Start Mode skill shot works by instantly spotting you poker chips until you get to 5. Doing so also extends your Winning Streak for each poker chip spotted. Thus, Start Mode is the ideal skill shot option at the start of the game or any other time you have 0 poker chips lit, because it will make progress toward the wizard mode but also dramatically increase the value of the next poker hand played.</p>

<h3>Modes</h3>

<p>Collecting 5 poker chips or making the Start Mode skill shot instantly starts the current flashing mode. There are 6 modes in total: 5 standard modes that can be played in any order, followed by Poker Championship multiball wizard mode. All standard modes last 30 seconds.</p>

<p><i>Coop's Cash:</i> The four main shots (both orbits, right ramp, up-kicker) are all lit to score 10,000,000 points. Make all 4 shots to light a moving lit shot worth 50,000,000 points. If you collect the moving shot, the mode restarts with a fresh 30-seconds and all mode scoring doubled. If you make all 5 shots a second time, the mode will reset again, but scoring does not increase past 20,000,000 per standard shot and 100,000,000 per moving lit shot.</p>

<p><i>Lauren Belle:</i> Orbit shots score 10,000,000 points, increasing by 10,000,000 each time to a maximum of 100,000,000 points. Each orbit also scores a mystery award: Infinite Discards, 20x Bonus, Mega Pops, Super Laser Kick, 50,000,000 points, extra ball, or special. This is by far the most valuable scoring mode in the game.</p>

<p><i>Bank Heist:</i> The Straight drop targets will be automatically lowered. Shots to the captive ball score 100,000,000, then 200,000,000, then 300,000,000 points. The second or third shot may light an extra ball as well.</p>

<p><i>Angel's Revenge:</i> a frenzy mode. All switches score the frenzy value, and also add the frenzy value to the mode jackpot. The frenzy value starts at 250,000 points and increases by 250,000 with every 10 switches hit. Collect the mode jackpot at the up-kicker, as many times as you can. Since the up-kicker sends the ball into the bumpers, this is a good way to build the jackpot as well as collect it.</p>

<p><i>Stagecoach:</i> the right ramp is constantly lit for a mode jackpot. The mode jackpot starts at 10,000,000 points and is increased by 1,000,000 per drop target hit and 10,000,000 per ramp shot.</p>

<p><i>Poker Tournament wizard mode:</i> a 4-ball multiball with unlimited ball save for 30 seconds. You must continue to plunge balls during the ball save time, as there is no autoplunger. The championship jackpot starts at 10,000,000 points. Each drop target hit down adds 1,000,000 times the number of balls in play to the jackpot. Each drop target <i>bank</i> completed adds 10,000,000 times the number of balls in play to the jackpot. Hitting the captive ball under the boat adds 100,000,000 to the jackpot. Completing all 4 drop target banks lights the up-kicker to collect the jackpot and reset all drop target banks. This process can be repeated as many times as possible until single ball play resumes after the initial 30 second timer has expired.</p>

<h3>Locks and multiball</h3>

<p>The right ramp lights locks, and the left orbit locks balls. To begin, just one shot to the right ramp is needed to qualify each lock, but this increases by 1 shot per lock for each time multiball has been played. <br>After locking ball 1, a new ball will be fed to the shooter lane, and the 1-2-3 holes on the skill shot will add 5,000,000 or 10,000,000 to the multiball jackpot as indicated on the DMD. Missing the skill shot adds just 1,000,000 to the jackpot.<br>After locking ball 2, you get a similar skill shot chance, but holes 1 and 3 will double the current jackpot, and hole 2 will instantly qualify 4-ball multiball. If you make the 4-ball multiball skill shot, you receive yet another skill shot where the three holes will double, triple, or double the jackpot. If the initial skill shot gets any result other than the 4-ball multiball start, you'll have to lock ball 3 manually at the left orbit. During a multiplayer game, you will not get a skill shot at all if you lock a ball when there were already 2 balls in the lock, making 4-ball multiball completely impossible.</p>

<p>During multiball, there are 3 jackpots at the right ramp. The jackpot has a base value of 5,000,000 points, is increased prior to multiball as described above, and is increased by 200,000 points per switch hit during multiball. After collecting 3 jackpots, a super jackpot is available at the captive ball under the boat, which starts at a flat 250,000,000 points and can also be increased by 200,000 points per switch. Collecting the super jackpot restarts the sequence.<br>If multiball ends with no jackpots made, a multiball restart is available at the left orbit for 15 seconds. This is a 2-ball multiball by default; if you make a skill shot, that will be increased to 3 balls, with an additional skill shot chance to double or triple the starting jackpot again.</p>

<p>Only Coop's Cash and Bank Heist modes can be brought into multiball. Multiball cannot be started while the other modes run.</p>

<h3>Right ramp</h3>

<p>Full orbit shots make progress toward lighting the right ramp for a Stagecoach Mystery award, which pulls from the same list of possible awards as the Lauren Belle main mode. The first mystery is lit after 3 orbit shots; subsequent mystery awards each require 1 more shot to qualify than the previous one did. A left orbit shot that locks a ball for multiball does not count toward the progress for Stagecoach Mystery.</p>

<p>If no mode is running and Stagecoach Mystery is not ready, shots to the ramp score Ramp Value, which starts each ball at 5,000,000 and increases by 1,000,000 each time it's collected, up to a maximum of at least 8,000,000.</p>

<h3>Bumpers and top lanes</h3>

<p>Bumpers start each ball scoring 250,000 points per pop. Every 10th pop increases the bumper value by 250,000, up to a maximum of 1,000,000. The Super Pops skill shot award lights all bumpers for 2,000,000 for the rest of the ball. The Mega Pops mystery award lights all bumpers for 3,000,000 for the rest of the ball.</p>

<p>There are 4 top lanes. The only ways to end up in the top lanes area are a weak orbit shot, or pop bumper luck following a shot to the up-kicker. Roll through an unlit top lane to light it. Lane change can be used with either flipper to rotate the lit lanes in either direction. Lighting all 4 top lanes advances the bonus multiplier in the sequence 2x-4x-6x-8x-10x. Only the mystery award can advance the bonus multiplier to 20x. Completing the top lanes when bonus multiplier is already at least 10x will score 20,000,000 points.</p>

<h3>Left out lane kickback and Blackjack</h3>

<p>There is an automatic kickback in the left out lane called the Laser Kick. Whenever it is not lit/has been used, the up-kicker will be lit for Blackjack, a video mode. You play a quick hand of blackjack against the house. The left flipper stands on your current total, and the right flipper hits (adds a card). Get as close to 21 as possible without going over, and beat the dealer as well. The dealer always stands on 17 or more, and always hits on 16 or less. Just like actual blackjack, aces can score 1 or 11. If you beat the dealer, you score 1,000,000 points times your hand value, and the kickback is relit. If you bust or the dealer wins, you get nothing. In arcade play, the game pulls randomly from a deck of cards to play the Blackjack. On tournament settings, every odd-numbered game of Blackjack (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc) will be rigged in the player's favor; if you follow the same rules as the dealer, standing only on 17 or more, you will always win a rigged game. If a mode or multiball is running, the up-kicker will not start Blackjack; instead, simply shooting the up-kicker twice during the mode or multiball is enough to relight the kickback. A setting within the game determines whether a tie in Blackjack counts as a win for the player or the house; by default, tie goes to the player.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Maverick has a conventional in/out lane setup. The left out lane has a kickback as described above. The right out lane can be lit for special by a mystery award. The in lanes light Spot Card; for about 3 seconds after rolling through an in lane, the up-kicker will be lit to spot a card in the current poker hand.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is calculated as 200,000 points per right ramp shot on that ball, plus 200,000 per playing card hit on that ball, plus 1,000,000 per poker chip won over the course of the game, all times the bonus multiplier. Bonus multiplier is advanced from the top lanes (2x-4x-6x-8x-10x) or mystery award (20x). Bonus tends not to be a meaningful part of scoring unless bonus multiplier is high; bonus is very significant if the 20x mystery award is earned. There is no carryover for bonus multiplier, and there is no mid-ball bonus collect.</p>
