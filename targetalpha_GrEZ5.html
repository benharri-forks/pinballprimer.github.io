<h1 style="color:purple;">Target Alpha / Solar City / Canada Dry (Gottlieb 1976)</h1>

<p>Target Alpha and Solar City are the same game; the former is 4-player and the latter is 2-player. Canada Dry is a 4-player version identical to Target Alpha, but rebranded to promote Canada Dry ginger ale.<br>This table layout was also used in El Dorado, Gold Strike, and El Dorado City of Gold, but with different scoring rules.</p>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Hit drop targets. The 10-bank lights the right extra ball and special lanes, and the 5 bank lights the left extra ball. After all targets are down, shoot for the top right 5,000 lanes.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Drop targets</h3>

<p>On 3 ball play, the top targets score 2,000 points each while the side targets score 500 points each. On 5 ball play, all drop targets score 300 points. Bonus at the end of the ball is equal to 1,000 points per hit drop target (doubled on the final ball). The bonus is where the vast majority of points in the game are, so don't tilt. There is no way to light the double bonus outside of the final ball. </p>

<p>Think carefully about which flipper is best for which targets. Specifically, note that the shooting from the upper right flipper toward the middle of the 10-bank is a horrendous angle that will cause center drains.</p>

<h3>Lanes</h3>

<p>The left and right top lanes as well as the out lanes score 500 points, or 5,000 when lit. 100-point switch hits cause the lights on these lanes to toggle.<br>The center top lane is always worth 500.<br>In lanes are always worth 1,000.<br>Left side lane scores 500 and is lit for extra ball if the 5-bank of targets is completed.<br>Right side lanes score 500 and are lit for extra ball or special accordingly after the entire 10-bank at the top is completed. (Extra ball and special cannot be worth score as far as I am aware.)</p>

<p>It's difficult to intentionally shoot for any of the lanes on this table. To return to the top lanes, make a shot from the lower left flipper toward the two rightmost targets in the upper bank, or use the upper left flipper. </p>

<h3>Bullseye standup targets</h3>

<p>Only notable for one reason: they are worth 1,000 points on 3 ball play, but only 100 on 5 ball.</p>
