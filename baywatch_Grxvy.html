<h1>Baywatch (Sega, 1995)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Track your progress on the 5 major shots in the game with the nearby inserts: tower ramp, back ramp, center up-kicker, right ramp, and right orbit. Make a single shot 3 times to start a mode. Make all 5 shots once or twice each to start additional modes. Make all 5 shots three times each and play out all 7 modes to light the up-kicker for Earthquake wizard mode.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Skill shot</h3>

<p>Use the flippers to pick one of three skill shots: Top Lanes, Shark Hole, and Side Ramp.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Top lanes:</b> The ball is sent up to the S-P-F top lanes. One is flashing (the P by default, but can be moved with flipper lane change). Go through the flashing lane to make the skill shot. Skill shots score 10,000,000, then 20,000,000, then 30,000,000.</li>
	<li><b>Shark hole:</b> The ball is fed to the lower right shark flipper. Shoot it into the Shark hole on the left side of the playfield just above the shark targets to make the skill shot. Scores 20,000,000, then 40,000,000, then 60,000,000.</li>
	<li><b>Side ramp:</b> This option also sends the ball to the shark flipper, so I have no idea how it's supposed to work. Supposedly, making the side ramp scores 50,000,000 points; I'm not sure if the value increases for making this skill shot more than once.</li>
</ul>
<p>On most Baywatches, the Top Lanes plunge will bounce once and fall directly into the flashing center lane. You can frequently earn this skill shot by doing absolutely nothing, which makes it my recommendation.<br>Making 3 of the same skill shot, or making the three different skill shots once each, scores a 50,000,000 point bonus and lights the bumpers for Squid Pops for the rest of the ball. This is just a further reason to stick with the Top Lanes skill shot, being the easiest one.</p>

<h3>Guard shots and modes</h3>

<p>The 5 major shots in the game must be made in certain quantities to start modes. Make a shot 3 times to start a mode. As well, make all 5 shots once or twice each to start additional modes. The 7 modes are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>CPR:</b> start by shooting the Tower ramp three times. Make three ramps in the game (Tower, back, and right: NOT the side ramp) within 30 seconds. The three ramps score 50,000,000, then 60,000,000, then 70,000,000 points. Completing the mode with all 3 ramps is supposed to award a 50,000,000 bonus, but that bonus is not shown in the mode summary screen and doesn't seem to be added to the score.</li>
	<li><b>Copter Rescue:</b> start by shooting the back ramp, between the Tower and the center up-kicker, three times. In 30 seconds, hit the yellow standup targets on either side of the three main ramps for 20,000,000 points each. Hit a total of 7 targets (any target counts, repeats are allowed) to complete the mode and earn the 50,000,000 bonus. This mode is best ignored, since all of the yellow standup targets are high center drain risks.</li>
	<li><b>Diver Trapped:</b> start by shooting the center up-kicker in the back middle of the game three times. The goal is to shoot any hole in the game: the left Shark scoop, the center up-kicker, or the kicker in the right orbit. Make any four holes (shots can be repeated) for 20,000,000, then 20,000,000, then 30,000,000, then 40,000,000 plus a 50,000,000 completion bonus.</li>
	<li><b>Shark Cove:</b> start by making the right ramp three times. One or more of the Shark standup targets in the lower left will be lit; lit targets move around the bank. At first, only 1 target will be lit. Hitting that target lights 2 targets; hitting both of those lights 3; hitting all of those lights 4. Making the Shark scoop clears all currently lit targets the first time it is made; after that, it just spots one target. Each Shark killed over the course of the mode scores 10,000,000 points, and there is a 50,000,000 bonus for clearing all 4 waves.</li>
	<li><b>Tidal Wave:</b> start by making the right orbit/spinner shot three times. The goal is to shoot an orbit so that the ball gets kicked around to the upper flipper to be comboed with a side ramp. The orbit shot scores 20,000,000; following it up with a side ramp shot scores 50,000,000. The mode ends if the 50,000,000 side ramp value is collected three times.</li>
	<li><b>Guard Millions:</b> start by making each of the five major shots once to spell Guard. This is a hurry-up mode where the goal is to make the 5 major shots again. The value of each shot starts at 50,000,000 and decreases by 1,000,000 per second; the mode ends when all 5 shots are made or when the countdown reaches 20,000,000. Making one of the flashing Guard shots scores the current value and freezes the countdown for about three seconds.</li>
	<li><b>Tourist Season:</b> the second shot to each of the five major shots collects a cast member: Mitch, Matt, CJ, Caroline, or Stephanie. Collect all 5 to start Tourist Season. This is a 2-ball multiball. The first objective is to shoot the right ramp 6 times for 25,000,000 points each to collect the countries Germany, Italy, France, Japan, USA, and England. Collecting all 6 of these scores a 25,000,000 bonus and lights the side ramp for a rotating value of 40,000,000, 50,000,000, 60,000,000, or 70,000,000 points for the rest of the 2-ball multiball.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a mode is running, other modes cannot be started, nor can progress be made toward other shots. </p>

<p>Playing all 7 modes- effectively equivalent to making all 5 major shots three times each when no other modes are running- lights the up-kicker in the back of the game for Earthquake wizard mode. Earthquake is a 5-ball multiball with unlimited ball save for 45 seconds. During this time, all major shots in the game score 10,000,000 points, except for the Guard tower left ramp, which scores 50,000,000 points plus an additional 10,000,000 for each mode <i>completed</i> in the game so far. This value builds even across multiple Earthquake modes: I've seen Tower Jackpot be worth 110,000,000 on a player's second time through. The DMD seems to imply that this mode can be won with enough tower shots in quick succession to pull the car up over the edge of the cliff, but this is either not possible or requires so many shots that it's unreasonable to achieve. When the 45 seconds is up. the game locks the flippers, and all balls drain. You then get to plunge again and start over.<br>Earthquake wizard mode can be started with enough Shark scoop shots; this is mentioned in more detail later in the guide. If Earthquake was started from the Shark hole, mode progress on the 5 major shots is retained after Earthquake ends. Otherwise, everything resets.</p>

<p>After one Earthquake is played, some mode progress is slightly more difficult; it takes 3 shots instead of 2 to collect a major shot's cast member, and accordingly, it takes 4 shots instead of 3 to light a major shot's mode. After two Earthquakes are played, it takes 2 shots to light a Guard letter, which in turn means it takes 4 shots to light a cast member and 5 to start a mode.</p>

<h3>Locks and Multiball</h3>

<p>Complete the 3 drop targets in the center of the playfield to light a lock at the left Tower ramp. These targets face the left side of the game and can be hit with either left flipper. (After a multiball has been played, the drop targets will reset if not cleared within about 15 seconds of the first one being knocked down.) Any left ramp shot then locks a ball for multiball, and locking 3 balls starts multiball.</p>

<p>Despite only requiring 3 locks, multiball on Baywatch is always a 5-ball affair. There are three phases:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Level 1: Guard shots</b> The 5 Guard shots are each lit for their own jackpot, and unlit when collected. Jackpots start at 30,000,000 points. The base value can be increased by 5,000,000 points with each completion of the center Light Lock drop targets, up to a base value of 90,000,000. When a jackpot is collected, the remaining jackpots will have their value doubled for about 5 seconds. Collect all 5 jackpots to advance.</li>
	<li><b>Level 2: Shark Super Jackpot</b> Shoot the left scoop to score a Super Jackpot and advance to level 3. The Super Jackpot is worth the sum of the 5 jackpots collected during level 1.</li>
	<li><b>Level 3: Side Ramp Double Super Jackpot</b> Shoot the right orbit to get a ball to the upper left flipper, then shoot the side ramp for a Double Super Jackpot worth 2x the value of the jackpot from level 2. Collecting the double super jackpot returns you to level 1 and resets the base jackpot value to 30,000,000.</li>
</ul>
<p>If multiball ends before any jackpots were collected, a restart is available at the left ramp for about 15 seconds. All normal rules apply, but only 3 balls are kicked into play instead of the usual 5.</p>

<h3>Shark awards</h3>

<p>When the ball is coming down the far right side of the game toward the Shark flipper, shoot the ball across the table and into the Shark scoop just above the lower left standup targets. This scores 10,000,000 points and gives one Shark credit. The following Shark credits give awards:</p>
<ul>
	<li>1 shark: 10,000,000 points and Waterski video mode. Move left or right to hit ramps and avoid debris and sea creatures. Very fast, very difficult. </li>
	<li>3 sharks: 20,000,000 points and Super Laser Kick. The left out lane kickback will be lit for the rest of the ball.</li>
	<li>6 sharks: 30,000,000 points and Shark Frenzy. Shark Flips will be lit for the remainder of the ball (see next paragraph).</li>
	<li>10 sharks: 50,000,000 points and Light Extra Ball, at the up-kicker.</li>
	<li>15 sharks: 100,000,000 points and Light Earthquake wizard mode, at the up-kicker.</li>
</ul>

<p>When no mode is running, hit the 5 Shark standup targets in the lower left of the game to spell Shark. Doing this enables Shark Flips one time. The next time the ball comes down the far right side of the game toward the shark flipper, the game will flip automatically, trying to put the ball in the left Shark scoop. If the game succeeds in doing this, 25,000,000 points are scored. The problem is, this basically never works. There is no auto-adjustment code on the timing of the autoflip, so the shark flip is grossly inaccurate the vast majority of the time. A lit Shark Flip is a one-time feature, unless Shark Frenzy was collected on the current ball. If Shark Flips is lit, you can override its use by holding up the right flipper before the ball triggers the rollover switch just above the shark flipper.</p>

<h3>S-P-F top lanes</h3>

<p>Aside from being the easiest of the three skill shots, the ball can sometimes end up here from a left orbit shot. The first 9 completions of S-P-F on a ball each increment the bonus multiplier from 2x to 10x. the first S-P-F completion after reaching 10x lights the up-kicker for an extra ball; any completions beyond that score 20,000,000 points. Lit S-P-F lanes can be moved in either direction with flipper lane change.</p>

<h3>Bumpers</h3>

<p>Bumpers score 250,000 points per hit to start. After 10 hits, this value increases 250,000 at a time up to a maximum of 1,000,000 points.<br>After making a third skill shot of the same type, or after making one skill shot of each type, or after playing Earthquake wizard mode, the bumpers are upgraded to Squid Pops, where they score 2,000,000 points for the rest of the ball. Squid Pops can also be activated for a single trip to the bumpers by making the left orbit immediately after rolling through the near right in lane.</p>

<h3>Side ramp</h3>

<p>Each side ramp shot outside of a mode or multiball scores 10,000,000 points and adds a letter in Ironman. (At the start of the game, I-R-O-N-M is spotted for free.) Complete Ironman to score 25,000,000 points and light the right orbit/spinner lane for Beach Runner video mode, where you mash the flipper buttons as fast as possible to earn 50,000,000 points.</p>

<h3>Vehicles</h3>

<p>The 5 yellow targets that surround the left Tower ramp, the back center ramp, and the right ramp correspond to 5 modes of emergency transportation: ATV, rescue truck, helicopter, wave runner, and scarab. Hit all 5 targets to collect the vehicles and light the right orbit/spinner lane for a Search and Rescue mystery award. Personally, I have only ever seen this mystery give 10,000,000 or 50,000,000 points, or Advance S-P-F: presumably, other awards could include other point values, Light Lock, Advance Shark, Light Extra Ball, Super Laser Kick, or start a mode.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Baywatch has a conventional in/out lane setup, but with two in lanes on the right side instead of one. <br>The left out lane has a kickback, called the Laser Kick. It is one time use and can be relit with the boogie board Laser Kick standup targets in the lower right of the game. It can also be upgraded into a Super Laser Kick, which does not unlight until the end of the current ball, with the 2nd Shark award.<br>The near left in lane lights the right orbit/spinner lane for Shark Flips (otherwise, this shot sends the ball up the playfield toward either the S-P-F lanes or around to the upper left flipper). The near right in lane lights the left orbit for Squid Pops for one trip to the bumpers. The far right in lane lights the left orbit for a Shark Flip.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>End of ball bonus appears to be calculated as 1,000,000 points per Guard letter collected in the game, plus 2,000,000 points per Lifeguard cast member collectedin the game, plus 3,000,000 points for each mode played during the game (including all 7 major shot modes and Earthquake). However, this is almost never added up correctly, with the subtotal usually being 1,000,000 or 2,000,000 more or less than what it seems like it should be. Regardless, all of those pieces are then multiplied by the S-P-F bonus multiplier, which is advanced by the top lanes or the Search and Rescue mystery. Max bonus is 10x and can never be carried from ball to ball. There is no mid-ball bonus collect. It usually takes a high multiplier for the end of ball bonus to not just be small potatoes.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>The Laser Kick left kickback can either be on at the start of each ball, off at the start of each ball, or have its status stay in memory between balls.</p>

<p>It can take 3, 4, 5, or 6 shots to start one of the "vertical" modes that correspond to making a single shot a certain number of times. By default, this number is 3, but increases each time Earthquake is played within a game.</p>
