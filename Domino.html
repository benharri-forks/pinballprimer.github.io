<h1 style="color:skyblue;">Domino (Gottlieb, 1968)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>The safest points on this table come from shooting back up toward the top corners trying to get the ball to land in the 500 point saucers. Lit top lanes, the top saucers, lit side targets, and the out lanes change which standup targets and lanes are lit for 100 points, and advance the lit domino. The saucers and the out hole spin the roto-target in the playfield center; hitting a target with a star or with the same number as the lit domino scores 500 points, when all other roto-target values score 100.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>There are 6 top lanes. 2 of them will be lit at any given time. Unlit lanes score 50 points. Lit lanes score 100 points and advance the domino. </p>

<h3>Bumpers</h3>

<p>The yellow bumpers or the red bumpers will always be lit, but never both sets at once. All bumpers score 1 point, or 10 points when lit.</p>

<h3>Upper saucers</h3>

<p>Score 500 points, advance the domino, and spin the roto-target in the center of the playfield. These are saucers are also lit for special by advancing the domino the end of the train (14 advances).</p>

<h3>Side standup targets</h3>

<p>One target in each group of three will be lit. Unlit standup targets score 50 points. Lit standup targets score 100 points and advance the domino.</p>

<h3>Center roto-target</h3>

<p>The center fan-shaped target scores 50 points, or 100 when lit. The panels on either side of the fan target (which are the ones that actually spin) score 100 points, or 500 points if the panel is a star or if the panel's number matches the currently lit domino.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Domino has no in lanes. The flippers back up directly to the slingshots. Out lanes score 100 points, and are lit for a special by advancing the domino to the end of the track. When the ball drains and lands in the out hole, the roto-target will spin to a new position.</p>

<h3>When are things lit?</h3>

<p>The left three top lanes, right three top lanes, left standup targets, and right standup targets each form sets of three features. One lane or target within each of these groups of three will be lit for 100 points and an advance. Earning a 100-point award + a domino advance from the lit lane/target, or entering the saucer, or going down and out lane, will rotate which lane or target in each of those groups of three is lit, and will also switch whether the red or yellow bumpers are lit. </p>

<p>The center fan target is lit on rotation with the groups of three mentioned above, meaning it will be lit 1/3 of the time.</p>

<p>Lit white lanes/targets and top saucers advance the domino. The lit domino value proceeds in this order: 5-3-4-1-2-3-4-2-1-5-3-1-4-2-6. After 14 advances, when the domino reaches the 6 at the end of the train, it is no longer possible to collect 500 points from the roto-target for hitting any panel other than the star, but instead, both top saucers and both out lanes will be lit for a Special.</p>

<h3>Bonus?</h3>

<p>There is no end of ball bonus. Progress on the domino train does carry over from ball to ball. Tilt ends game.</p>
