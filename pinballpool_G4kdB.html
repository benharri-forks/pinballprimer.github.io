<h1>Pinball Pool (Gottlieb, 1979)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>If extra balls and specials are meaningful to you, it's pretty much a requirement to plunge the B lane; otherwise, top lanes don't matter. During gameplay, advance the bonus multiplier at either top saucer, then complete the drop targets, then collect the bonus at either top saucer once you complete a rack to allow the drop targets to be collected again, and repeat.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>A-B-C letters</h3>

<p>Any lane that gives an A-B-C letter scores 5,000 points, and awards that letter if lit. Collecting all three of A-B-C lights the 8 ball captive ball for an extra ball; completing A-B-C and collecting the 8 ball extra ball lights the top saucers for a special. The A and C can be collected from in lanes, but the B is only available from the center top lane, and it's nearly impossible to get back to the top of the table to collect a new lane after the plunge, so the extra ball and special basically require collecting B on the plunge.</p>

<h3>Bumpers</h3>

<p>Unlabelled, but always score 1,000 points.</p>

<h3>Upper saucers</h3>

<p>The saucers score 5,000 points and advance the bonus multiplier toward the maximum of 5x. If all 15 pool balls have been collected, these saucers are lit for Collect Bonus, where they will score 15,000 points times the current bonus multiplier (after adding to it, if it was not already maxed out) and then unlight the pool balls and reraise the drop targets to be collected again. If A-B-C has been completed and the 8 ball has been lit, these saucers will be lit for a special. </p>

<h3>Drop targets</h3>

<p>Each drop target down scores 3,000 points and collects the corresponding pool ball. On default settings, hitting any drop target will also knock down and score the target in the same vertical position in the opposite bank, but this can be changed so that none of the targets in the two banks are tied together, or only odd numbers in the same position are tied together. </p>

<h3>Center captive ball</h3>

<p>Hitting the captive ball hard enough to trigger the rollover switch scores 5,000 points and awards the 8 ball. Unlike real pool and unlike most pool-themed pinball tables. the 8 can be collected at any time, with no need to finish the drop targets first or anything. If A-B-C has been completed, making this rollover switch scores an extra ball. This is a rather difficult shot, so don't go for it unnecessarily and be ready for a save when you do go for it.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Pinball Pool has a conventional in/out lane setup. All in/out lanes score 5,000 points. The out lanes advance the bonus multiplier if it is not already maxed out at 5x. The left in lane awards the A, and the right in lane awards the C. </p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is simply 1,000 per collected pool ball times the bonus multiplier, for a maximum of 5x 15,000 = 75,000 points. Bonus multiplier is earned from the top saucers or the out lanes. If the rack of 15 pool balls is completed, the bonus can be collected mid-ball at the top saucers. Doing so resets the base bonus to 0, but raises all drop targets to be collected again. Base bonus and bonus multiplier cannot be carried over from ball to ball.</p>
