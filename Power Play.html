<h1 style="color:blue;">Bobby Orr's Power Play (Bally, 1978)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>First, complete either bank of drop targets 3 times to advance the bonus multiplier to 5x. Second, shoot up to the top of the table repeatedly, aiming for saucer hits and eventually the lanes with lit star rollovers. Once bonus and bonus X are high, return to drop targets and pick off 50,000 point extra balls and specials.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top rollover button</h3>

<p>Scores 1,000 points, advances the bonus, and raises the center post between the flippers.</p>

<h3>Top saucer</h3>

<p>Landing in the saucer scores and advances the lit value, and also 3 bonus advances. 3,000 is lit at first, the value progresses by 3,000 each time up to 15,000 points. Collecting the 6,000 award from the saucer lights the star rollovers in the left orbit for bonus advance. Collecting the 12,000 award lights the right orbit star rollovers and also lights a special alternately on the out lanes. </p>

<h3>Pop bumpers</h3>

<p>100 points, or 1,000 when lit. Either the left and right bumpers will be lit, or the center bumper will be lit, alternately; all three will never be lit at once.</p>

<h3>Left and right drop target 4-banks</h3>

<p>Each target down scores 300 points. Completing either bank scores 3,000 points, 3 bonus advances, and the lit award in the center of the table- 2x bonus, 3x bonus, 5x bonus, extra ball, and special. Note as well that completing <i>either</i> bank of drop targets causes <i>both</i> banks to reset. </p>

<h3>Center standup target</h3>

<p>Raises the center post and advances the bonus.</p>

<h3>Left and right orbits</h3>

<p>Return the ball to the top of the table. Each star rollover scores 100 points, and also a bonus advance when lit. The left star rollovers are lit by collecting the 6,000 point top saucer award, and the right star rollovers are lit by collecting the 12,000.</p>

<h3>Center rollover buttons</h3>

<p>The uppermost button scores 1,000 points and a bonus advance. The other two buttons score 100 points and lower the center post if it is raised.</p>

<h3>Upper flippers</h3>

<p>At the mouth of each orbit lane is a mini flipper, designed to make it easier to shoot at the 4-banks of drop targets. Use these flippers with caution. Hitting the flipper button too late as the ball comes down a lane could send it rocketing into the opposite out lane; simply holding up the flipper to slow the ball in an attempt to gain control can end up with a center drain. These flippers frequently add unnecessary horizontal momentum to the ball and using them is best avoided in many cases, since all the drop targets can be hit just fine with the standard flippers.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is advanced by the top rollver button, orbit rollover buttons when lit, center target, center rollover button, and in lanes. The top saucer and any drop target completion give 3 bonus advances. <br>Bonus multipliers are awarded by the first three completions of either 4-bank of drop targets. Max bonus is 5x 29,000 = 145,000 points. <br>Bonus count and bonus multiplier cannot be carried over from ball to ball in any way. There is no way to collect the bonus mid-ball.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Power Play has a conventional in/out lane setup. Out lanes score 1,000 points, or spcial when lit. The out lanes are lit alternately for special by advancing the saucer value up to its max value of 15,000 points. <br>The in lanes score 300 points, advance the bonus, and lower the center post between the flippers if it is currently raised. The in lanes cannot be lit for any additional value.</p>

<p>There is a center post between the flippers, temporarily removing the risk of a center drain as a reward. The post is raised by the top star rollover above the saucer or the center standup target. The post is lowered by the two lower center star rollovers and the in lanes. Be very careful relying on the center post to be there, as a ball coming down the table could trigger one of the down post rollovers leaving the player minimal time to change their strategy to get the ball under control.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>In competition/novelty play, extra balls and specials both score 50,000 points.</p>

<p>The drop targets can be set to award 5X bonus and the extra ball simultaneously on the 3rd drop target completion. By default, these awards are separate, with 5X at the third completion and extra ball at the fourth.<br>Also, the drop targets can be set to only have the completed side reset, instead of resetting both banks when either bank is completed.</p>

<p>The star rollover buttons in the orbits can score 1,000 points each instead of 100.</p>

<p>The pop bumpers can be set to always be all on, instead of alternating the top two with the bottom one.</p>
