<h1 style="color:green;">Lost World (Bally, 1978)</h1>

<p>Not to be confused with Bally's Escape from the Lost World (1988) or Sega's The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1998).</p>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Complete the A through F letters around the playfield to light 5X bonus. Then, if the ejects out of the saucers are friendly, shoot them all day for the increasing awards, otherwise shoot the spinner and keep the ball at the top of the table.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>A through F lanes and targets</h3>

<p>A and B are at the top of the table, obtainable on the plunge or a trip up the spinner lane. C and E are in the lower left of the table, while D and F are in the lower right. Any letter target or lane scores 300 points and one bonus advance. <br>Collecting various combinations of letters does the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Collecting A-B lights the captive ball shot for 5,000 points instead of 500.</li>
	<li>Collecting A-B-C-D lights the captive ball shot for an extra ball one time. Extra ball is worth only 15,000 points in competition/novelty play.</li>
	<li>Collecting C-D lights 2X bonus.</li>
	<li>Collecting C-D-E-F lights 3X bonus.</li>
	<li>Collecting A-B-C-D-E-F lights 5X bonus and also lights the out lanes alternately for a special.</li>
</ul>

<p>Always make collecting letters the first priority on a ball. Use the spinner lane to return to the top of the table to finish A and B. Remember that letters that are lit are the ones that have NOT yet been collected.</p>

<h3>Other features in the top of the table</h3>

<p>To the left of the A-B lanes is a star rollover that scores 50 points and advances the bonus.<br>The bumpers are always lit and award the shown value (100 for the top two, 1,000 for the bottom). <br>There is an inconspicuous, unlabelled red standup target at the right of the upper playfield; this target gives 300 points and a bonus advance just like the other red standups, but is not tied to any letter.</p>

<h3>Spinner</h3>

<p>The spinner always scores 100 points per spin, and its value cannot be increased. Every 5th spin advances the bonus.</p>

<h3>Captive ball "Dragon's Den"</h3>

<p>Hitting the captive ball all the way to the target in the back scores only 500 points. This is increased to 5,000 (repeatable) if A and B have been collected, and extra ball (collectible once) if A-B-C-D has been completed. Captive ball shots do not advance bonus, surprisingly. This shot is best avoided entirely unless it is lit for extra ball and extra balls are actually on (not even the 15,000 point value for extra balls in competition/novelty play makes this worth it, as the drain risk by hitting the posts to either side on a miss is too great).

<h3>Saucers</h3>

<p>Making a saucer scores and advances the lit values in order from left to right across the middle playfield. The saucers are unlit to begin; the first hit lights the 1,000, and from there the scoring progression goes 2,000-4,000-6,000-8,000-10,000-special. In competition/novelty play, the special is worth 50,000 points. Any saucer hit also advances the bonus. If the kickouts from one or both saucers are friendly and easily controllable- which is usually the case with a dead bounce- then go for the saucers repeatedly after 5X bonus is lit. </p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Lost World has a conventional in/out lane setup. The out lanes score 1,000 points, and are lit alternately for special when all 6 letters have been completed. The in lanes score 500 points, and are lit alternately for Advance Saucer, which advances but does not score the lit saucer value.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is advanced by the saucers, every 5th hit to the spinner, the top rollover lanes, and any standup target on the playfield. Bonus multiplier is advanced as discussed in the "A through F lanes and targets" section above. Max bonus is 5x 29,000 = 145,000 points. Base bonus count, bonus multiplier, lit extra balls and specials, and progress on the letters is all reset between balls.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>On conventional replay settings, specials award free games and extra balls are self explanatory.<br>On extra ball only settings, specials score 10,000 points instead, and extra balls are still self explanatory. <br>On novelty/competition settings, specials score 50,000 and extra balls score 15,000.<br>These are the only possible permutations of values for the special and the extra ball. If possible, gauge from the rules card in the machine which settings are present on your local game.</p>

<p>The saucers can be set to start with the 1,000 lit at the start of the ball, instead of nothing being lit and the 1,000 lamp being lit as the first advance.<br>The saucers can also be set to either give the special repeatedly at the end of the sequence, or to have every saucer hit be worth 10,000 points after the special has been collected.</p>

<p>On Extra Ball Only settings, the "replay scores" on the apron give extra balls instead. If an extra ball is collected when Same Player Shoots Again is already lit, 10,000 points are scored instead. This is only possible by collecting the captive ball EB and reaching a scoring threshold on the same ball while the game is set to Extra Ball Only mode.</p>
