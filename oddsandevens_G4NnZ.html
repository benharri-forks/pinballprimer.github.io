<h1>Monte Carlo / Odds and Evens (Bally, 1973)</h1>

<p>Monte Carlo is the 4-player version, Odds and Evens is the 1-player version. This guide focuses on Monte Carlo, with differences in Odds and Evens discussed at the end of the page.<br>Not to be confused with Monte Carlo (Premier Gottlieb, 1987).</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Shoot the center saucer or the left orbit until all five black odd numbers have been collected, then shoot the center saucer all day once it's lit for 5,000s. Putting the ball in either saucer raises the center post between the flippers. The center saucer is somewhat more reliable as a shot, since left orbit shots usually zoom past the left saucer. Lower left mushroom bumpers open the right candy cane lane at two different points for 2,000 or 4,000, but this is not as good for long term scoring as picking a saucer to whale on. Collecting all five numbers of one colour scores 10,000 points in extra end of ball bonus.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>1-10 numbers</h3>

<p>The main feature of the game. 1-3-5-7-9 are black, 2-4-6-8-10 are red. Numbers can be collected in two ways: the top rollover buttons, or the saucers. The top rollover buttons give 100 points. The saucers will be lit for one number at a time; odds at the center saucer, evens at the left saucer. Saucers score 500 points, unless all five numbers of a colour have been collected, in which case they score 5,000. Saucers also always raise the center post between the flippers. Entering a saucer or hitting any 10-point switch will rotate which number is lit at each saucer. Saucers can be lit to award a number that you already have, which provides no benefits other than the 500 points and center post. At the end of the ball, you'll receive 1,000 points of end of ball bonus for each number collected, plus 5,000 bonus for each colour completed; this plus the increased saucer value means it's very important to work on one colour at the cost of the other instead of trying to build both equally.</p>

<p>Collecting all five red numbers lights the left saucer for extra ball. Collecting all ten numbers overall lights the upper gate of the candy cane lane for a special.</p>

<h3>Bumpers</h3>

<p>Score 10 points, or 100 when lit. The lower yellow bumper is always lit. The upper blue bumpers are lit alternately, swapping every time a saucer is entered.</p>

<h3>Right candy cane lane</h3>

<p>The blue mushroom bumper in the lower left opens the upper gate, and the red mushroom bumper in the lower left opens the lower gate. The gates are indicated with white lights on the playfield and just refer to the two locations at which this lane can be entered. Entering at the top gate scores 4,000 points, and entering at the lower gate earns 2,000. In each case, the ball will be directed toward the right flipper from above the right out lane, and both gates will be closed whether they were lit or not. The top gate is lit for a special after collecting all 10 numbers.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>There are no in lanes, and the flippers back up directly to the slingshots. Out lanes score 1,000 points.<br>There is a center post that completely blocks off the center drain. It is raised by entering either saucer at any time and lowered by the two rollover buttons positioned above the tops of the slingshots.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is 1,000 points per lit number, plus an additional 5,000 points for each completed colour. A total of 20,000 bonus is possible. There is no way to multiply the bonus, and lit numbers are reset after each ball.</p>

<h3>Differences in Odds and Evens, the 1-player version</h3>

<p>There is no end of ball bonus, and lit numbers persist from ball to ball. There is also no extra ball available for collecting all even numbers, but the upper gate is still lit for special one time when all 10 numbers have been collected.</p>

<p>Instead of opening the two gates, the two mushroom bumpers in the lower left will open or <i>close</i> the lower gate. The upper gate is not available until all 10 numbers have been collected and special is lit; after that, it stays open for the rest of the game, allowing a repeatable 4,000-point shot.</p>
