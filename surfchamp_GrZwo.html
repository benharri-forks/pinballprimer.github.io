<h1 style="text-align:center">Surf Champ / Surfer (Gottlieb, 1976)</h1>

<p>Surf Champ is the 4 player version. Surfer is the 2 player version. The two games have identical rulesets and gameplay.</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Roll over the 5 star rollovers in the center of the table to unlight them and max out the value of the upper right hole at 5,000 per shot, then shoot that hole repeatedly. Base bonus is built from top lanes and drop targets, but it's difficult enough to build bonus that it is typically a surprisingly low part of scoring. Collecting all 5 rollovers lights the side lanes, which lights double bonus (or turns double bonus into triple bonus on the final ball). Completing the star rollovers and the drop targets lights the out lanes for extra ball and special.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>There are four top lanes in the normal position, and a fifth off to the left that exacts as a semi-left orbit lane. Any lane scores 500 points. One of the five lanes will be lit; unlit lanes score 1 bonus advance, while lit lanes can be set to award 2, 3, or 5 bonus advance. Each spin of the spinner changes which of the five top lanes is lit for the extra bonus.</p>

<h3>Drop targets</h3>

<p>Each target down scores 500 points and a bonus advance. There is no award for completing the drop targets on their own; however, if the five star rollovers have been completed as well, all targets down scores 5,000 points, resets the drop targets, and lights the out lanes alternately (extra ball on left, special on right).</p>

<p>The right flipper, which seems to be the most natural choice for hitting these drop targets, cannot hit the two uppermost/rightmost drop targets in this bank directly, due to the left post of the spinner being in the way. Complete this bank of targets with a left flipper backhand or ricochet out of the bumpers.</p>

<h3>Bumpers</h3>

<p>Score 100 points in 5-ball play and 1,000 points in 3-ball play.</p>

<h3>Upper right hole</h3>

<p>Scores 1,000 points for each star rollover that has been collected, plus 100 points for each star rollover that has not been collected. Possible values of this hole, then, are 500, 1,400, 2,300, 3,200, 4,100, or 5,000 points. Get a few star rollovers then shoot this hole repeatedly for the best consistent points in the game.</p>

<h3>Center spinner</h3>

<p>Scores 10 points per spin, or 100 per spin when lit. Collect all 5 star rollovers to light the spinner for the remainder of the ball. Each spin of the spinner changes which of the top lanes is lit for extra bonus.</p>

<h3>Side lanes</h3>

<p>Score 500 points. After all five center star rollovers are collected, one or both of these lanes (depending on game settings) will be lit for Increase Bonus Multiplier. On the final ball of the game, this will turn the 2x bonus that you start with into 3x bonus. On all other balls, this takes you from single bonus to double. The bonus multiplier can only be increased once per ball, so you cannot get 3x bonus unless it is the final ball of the game.</p>

<h3>Star rollovers</h3>

<p>Always score 100 points, in additional to all the goodies you get from rolling over all 5 of them as described in previous sections.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Surf Champ has a conventional in/out lane setup. In lanes score 500 points. Out lanes score 500 points and a bonus advance. If the drop targets and star rollovers have all been completed at least once on the current ball, the left out lane will be lit for extra ball and the right out lane will be lit for special.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Drop targets, unlit top lanes, and out lanes advance bonus once. Lit top lanes score 2, 3, or 5 bonus advances depending on game settings. Max base bonus is 15,000 points. Lit side lanes can increase the bonus multiplier once per ball. Double bonus is given for free on the final ball of the game. Max bonus is 3x 15,000 = 45,000 points on the final ball of the game, and 2x 15,000 = 30,000 points otherwise. It tends to be very difficult to build up a lot of bonus because of the difficulty involved in getting back to the top lanes and hitting some of the drop targets. There is no carryover for base bonus or multiplier, and there is no mid-ball bonus collect.</p>
