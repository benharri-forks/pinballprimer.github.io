<h1>Stellar Wars (Williams, 1979)</h1>

<p>Not to be confused with any games involving Star Wars, such as Star Wars (Data East, 1992), Star Wars Trilogy (Sega, 1997), Star Wars Episode I (Bally Williams, 1999), or Star Wars (Stern, 2017).</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Complete the upper right drop targets 3 times in one ball to light the spinners for 1,000 points per spin. Left drop targets increase bumper value. Center drop targets increase left hole value. Complete 1-2-3-4, Stellar, or Wars to advance bonus multiplier. The safest shot is generally a spinner shot that gets back to the top lanes for a chance at more bonus or bonus multipliers, even if the spinners aren't lit. There is no one-way gate at the left entrance to the top lanes, so don't full plunge or you risk the ball zooming around to a center drain.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>On the plunge</h3>

<p>A full plunge goes across the top of the game above the top lanes and down the left spinner lane, directly toward the bottom center of the table. This is a very high speed feed and requires lightning-fast reactions to save, if it's even possible to do so. Never full plunge! For your own safety, plunge just hard enough that the ball ends up in the top lanes.</p>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>All lanes always score 1,000 points and a bonus advance. Roll through an unlit lane to light it. Lighting 1-2-3-4 increases the bonus multiplier toward its maximum of 5x. Lit lanes cannot be rotated with flipper lane change in any way, no matter how badly you wish they could be.</p>

<h3>Left drop targets and bumpers</h3>

<p>Each left drop target down scores 1,000 points and a bonus advance. Completing this bank once scores 5,000 points and lights the top bumpers, increasing their value from 100 to 1,000 points. Completing this bank a second time in the same ball will score 10,000 points and flash the top bumpers, indicating they now score 2,000 per pop. Additional completions of these targets on the same ball just score 5,000 points.</p>

<h3>Center drop targets and left saucer</h3>

<p>Each target down scores 1,000 points. Each completion of this bank increases the value of the left saucer from 2,000, to 5,000, then 10,000, then extra ball, then an alternating special lit at the out lanes. The saucer value is held over from ball to ball.</p>

<h3>Upper right drop targets and other features</h3>

<p>Each target down scores 1,000 points. Completing this bank once scores 5,000 points and lights the captive ball. The captive ball scores 5,000 points when not lit, and 10,000 plus spots one Stellar Wars letter when lit.<br>Completing this bank a second time scores 10,000 points and lights the lower bumpers above the out lanes for 1,000 points.<br>A 3rd completion of this bank on one ball scores 15,000 points and lights both spinners for 1,000 points per spin.<br>A 4th completion of this bank on one ball scores 20,000 points and lights the lower right standup target for a special.<br>Any further completions of this target bank on the same ball score 30,000 points.</p>

<p>This target bank is located in an odd place. The leftmost drop target is obscured from the left flipper by the center bank. Use a right flipper backhand shot or a lucky ricochet to complete this bank.</p>

<h3>Stellar Wars letters</h3>

<p>The S and T in Stellar are the nearest and furthest targets of the left drop target bank. The E-L-L-A in Stellar are the four drop targets in the center bank. The R in Stellar is the center drop target in the upper right bank. Spelling Stellar adds one bonus multiplier.<br>The four letters in the word Wars are spread across the four in lanes. Spelling Wars also adds one bonus multiplier.<br>Spelling both Stellar and Wars scores an instant 50,000 points and unlights all letters so they can begin to be collected again.</p>

<p>When lit, the captive ball spots Stellar Wars letters. The inserts on the table that point to drop targets with single letters in the word Stellar are unhelpful and displaying your progress, as the lights are always on whether that letter is collected or not; you must look at the large circle between the slingshots to see what letters have been collected.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Stellar Wars has a conventional in/out lane setup, but with two in lanes instead of one on each side. These four in lanes are where the letters in Wars are collected. All in lanes score 1,000 points and a bonus advance. Out lanes score 2,000 points and 2 bonus advances, and can be lit for Special by completing the center drop targets when Extra Ball is already lit (5 times in total).</p>

<p>As you go from the tops of the slingshots to the edges of the table, note that each lane divider is lower than the last. It is frustratingly common for a ball to "walk" along these lane dividers and end up in the out lanes. Be ready to nudge to prevent this, either upward to knock the ball away or to the side to help the ball fall down an in lane.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is advanced by any top lane, any in lane, and any shot to the captive ball or left saucer. Out lanes award 2 bonus advances. Max base bonus is 29,000 points. Bonus multipliers are awarded for completing any set of 1-2-3-4, Stellar, or Wars. Max bonus is 5x 29,000 = 145,000 points. There is no mid ball bonus collect. Base bonus can never be carried from ball to ball. Bonus multipliers are held from ball to ball, unless the maximum bonus X of 5x is achieved.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>In competition/novelty play, specials score 50,000 points. Extra balls cannot be assigned a point value.</p>

<p>The center drop targets can be set to increase the left saucer straight from unlit to 5,000 points, meaning it takes one less completion of the center drops to light the extra ball or out lane specials.</p>

<p>The captive ball can be lit at the same time as the lower pop bumpers, after 1 completion of the upper right targets. Activating this setting would require one less completion of the upper right drops to light the spinners or the lower right standup target special.</p>

<p>Bonus multiplier and the left saucer value can both be reset between balls rather than carrying over. Even if bonus multiplier carryover is on, a 5x bonus multiplier will be completely lost before the next ball, and there is no way to change or prevent this.</p>
