<h1 style="text-align:center">Riverboat Gambler (Bally Williams, 1990)</h1>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Advance the Win Meter by winning casino games: poker (drop targets flash cards, right ramp locks them in), blackjack (dead-end target), slots (lower the left ramp with lit right in lane or looping under the raised ramp), the precise-power-plunge skill shot, roulette (shoot under raised left ramp after collecting 100 chips), and spelling Chips at the lower right targets. Winning a total of 7 of all games combined qualifies Jackpot Roulette. Winning one of each game scores 2,000,000 points.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Skill shot</h3>

<p>The skill shot is a precise power plunge on the red plastic ramp labelled Skill Shot. The object is to shoot so that the ball goes just past the #3 insert, then falls back down the ramp. The switches labelled 1, 2, and 3 score 10,000, 20,000, and 30,000 points. A successful skill shot scores 100,000 points times the number of balls played by the current player (including extra balls), but overflows back to 0 on the 16th ball played. <br>A successful skill shot or a skill shot that was too soft will flash one bumper for each of the 1-2-3 switches hit. Unlit bumpers score 100 points and 1 chip. Flashing bumpers score 1,000 points and 3 chips. A skill shot that was too hard will still score the 60,000 points from the 1-2-3 switches, but will not light any bumpers.</p>

<p>A successful skill shot also lights the letter I in CASINO, awards 100 chips, and instantly starts a standard Roulette round (see the letter N under Chips and Casino games).</p>

<p>Skill shots are always available, including at the start of a ball or after a ball takes the emergency exit out of the right out lane and back into the shooter lane.</p>

<h3>Chips and Casino games</h3>

<p>Situated around the playfield are 6 Casino games.</p>

<p><i>C: Poker.</i> Each drop target down in either bank (Five or Card) scores 10,000 points. Complete a bank to make one of the five playing cards in the royal flush flash. When a card is flashing, shoot the right ramp to light it solidly. Cards can also be spotted by comboing the right ramp multiple times in a row or shooting the right ramp immediately after rolling through the left in lane when lit. Lighting all 5 cards in the royal flush scores 500,000 points, either 100 or 200 chips (the award alternates with slingshot hits throughout the game), lights the C in CASINO, and advances the Win Meter one level. <br>The right ramp shot that solidly lights the final card and scores the royal flush starts a Royal Flush Combo, where you can keep recollecting all of the royal flush completion goodies by looping the right ramp repeatedly without missing. Due to what is probably a bug, if the ball drains before the Royal Flush Combo times out, the right ramp will be lit for an entire royal flush for free at the start of the next ball, but only if no extra balls aka "Second Chances" are lit.</p>

<p><i>A: Blackjack.</i> Hit the bullseye target at the end of the left dead-end lane three times to be dealt three 7s. The first scores 20,000 points, the second scores 50,000, and the third scores 200,000 plus 75 chips, the A in CASINO, and a Win Meter advance. Subsequent blackjacks score the same points, but more Chips for completion: doubling each time to 150, 300, 600, then maxing at 1,200. After one blackjack has been collected, the standup target to the right of the dead-end lane will be lit for a Queen after two 7s have been collected; hitting this target busts your blackjack hand, cancelling your progress. The Queen target will never be lit to bust your blackjack hand during multiball.</p>

<p><i>S: Slot machine.</i> Slots are played by shooting a ball up the lowered left ramp. However, the ramp is usually raised. To lower it, you must either make consecutive shots under the raised ramp- 2 in a row for the first Slots play, increasing by 1 each time, up to a maximum of 5 shots in a row- or, simply roll through the right in lane when lit. The in-a-row method lowers the ramp indefinitely, while the lit right in lane lowers it for just a few seconds. Shooting the lowered left ramp scores 100,000 points, the S in CASINO, a Win Meter advance, and a random award based on what the "reels" on the alphanumeric display decide to give you. Also, playing the slots starts Multiball, which has basically no rule changes over single ball play except for Roulette being completely unavailable with two balls on the playfield and the Queen target never lighting for a blackjack bust until one ball drains. The under-ramp shot scores 100,000 points, 25 chips, and a Win Meter advance during multiball.</p>
<ul>
	<li>2 bells: 100,000 points, 25 chips</li>
	<li>2 bars: 200,000 points, 50 chips</li>
	<li>2 777s: 300,000 points, 75 chips</li>
	<li>3 bells: 1,000,000 points, 100 chips</li>
	<li>3 bars: 2,000,000 points, 200 chips</li>
	<li>3 777s: 3,000,000 points, 300 chips, and a special</li>
	<li>Any stars: are added to your Lucky Star total. Reaching a total of three is worth a Second Chance (extra ball)</li>
	<li>Junk (any combo not listed above): 50,000 points</li>
</ul>

<p><i>I: skill shot.</i> See previous section.</p>

<p><i>N: roulette.</i> Roulette is lit under the raised left ramp after a total of 100 Chips are collected from anywhere else on the table, and cannot be played during multiball. When you make the under-ramp shot while it's lit for Play Roulette, the ball will be held on the right side of the playfield, and you will be prompted to pick a colour using the buttons on the lockdown bar- red, green, or black. Then, the roulette wheel spins. If you guessed the correct colour, you earn 100 chips (for red or black) or 800 chips (for correctly guessing green) as well as the letter N and a Win Meter advance. Roulette can be repeatedly played until you lose or the ball drains. When you guess incorrectly, 100 chips are subtracted and the progressive jackpot is raised by 100,000 points. If you'd like, you can press the white button to pass on playing roulette. You will keep your 100 chip bet (which is worth 100,000 points in end of ball bonus), and the pinball is returned. Roulette will stay lit if you pass.<br>If the Win Meter is fully advanced, Jackpot Roulette is instantly qualified. During Jackpot Roulette, a correct Roulette guess wins the entire current jackpot; an incorrect guess adds half of your current chip bank to the jackpot (chips x 1,000 = points). If you collected a jackpot first, guessing incorrectly will reset the jackpot to its base value before adding the value of half your chips. The jackpot can also be continuously recollected from Jackpot Roulette for as long as you don't guess wrong or drain. There's no bonus for guessing Green during Jackpot Roulette, so statistically you should always choose red, black, or pass. The jackpot is built across players and games; its base value is usually 3,000,000 and it maxes at 9,999,000. Jackpot Roulette wins can either be purely random based on the spin of the wheel, or "rigged" to result in wins a certain percentage of the time. Losing at Jackpot Roulette empties the entire Win Meter.</p>

<p><i>O: collect Chips.</i> The lower right standup targets have a flashing award in front of them: 10, 20, or 50 chips, or a Lucky Star. All standup targets will light up when hit, score 8,000 points when not lit, and 3,000 points when lit. Lighting one target in the bank locks in the scanning value. Lighting all 5 targets awards said locked-in value as well as the O in CASINO and a Win Meter advance. If you start the final ball of the game with a very low score or playtime, the game will give you two Lucky Stars for free and lock in the scanning award as a Star, meaning all it takes to earn a quick consolation extra ball is to complete the lower right standup targets once.</p>

<p>Lighting all 6 letters in CASINO scores 2,000,000 points and unlights them all so you can start again. End of ball bonus is simply equal to 1,000 points times the number of Chips in your current bank: this can be up to 9,999 chips for 9,999,000 points in end of ball bonus. Keep an eye on this total, especially in a multiplayer setting, as a high enough chip bank very frequently means it is preferable to hold on to guaranteed points in the end of ball bonus rather than risk some or half of your chips on a Roulette game. There is no bonus multiplier: the calculation is always 1,000 times your chip total.</p>

<h3>Lucky Stars and Second Chance (extra ball)</h3>

<p>Lucky Stars can be awarded from the slots, the lower right standup targets, or by any spin of the roulette wheel that lands on a star (whether the spin was a win or a loss). Collecting 3 stars over the course of the game lights Second Chance. Second Chance is this game's version of an extra ball, but it acts more like a one-time-use ball save that protects against any drain. When the ball leaves the playfield with Second Chance lit, a new ball is put in the shooter lane and you continue playing- features in progress do not unlight or reset, and your end of ball bonus is not scored. Lucky Stars can be disabled outright; this does not remove them from the features that could otherwise award them, it just means there's no reward for collecting three or any other number of them.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Riverboat Gambler has a conventional in/out lane setup. One of the four in/out lanes is always lit. The lit lane can be rotated in either direction with flipper lane change. Lit out lanes add 50 chips to your bank, and that's it. Lit left in lane lights the right ramp for Spot Royal Flush Card for a few seconds. Lit right in lane will lower the left ramp, making the slot machine available for a few seconds.</p>

<p>The right out lane has an emergency exit gap. A ball travelling very quickly horizontally toward the right out lane, or a ball that gets a fun bounce off the top of the right slingshot, could go through this gap and fall into the shooter lane. This gives another chance at the skill shot, and is a valid way to save the ball. However, note that in tournament play, you must plunge a ball that goes out the emergency exit at the first possible opportunity if it happens during multiball.</p>

<h3>Bonus</h3>

<p>See the end of the "Chips and Casino games" section.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>Anything that is lit temporarily (Winning Streaks, Slots, Poker card spotting, etc) can have its timer individually changed. I'm not going to bother listing them all...</p>

<p>The Queen target that busts your blackjack hand can be set to start lighting up after 0, 1, 2, or 3 blackjacks have been won, or the penalty can be disabled outright. Default is 1.</p>

<p>Up to 3 royal flush cards and up to 4 advances of the Win Meter can be spotted at the start of the game.</p>

<p>The Win Meter can be on a constant timer, losing one step if no casino games are won within a time limit of between 10 and 30 seconds. By default, this is disabled outright, and the Win Meter never steps down.</p>

<p>Lit royal flush cards for the Poker feature will not be reset if the ball drains, but flashing cards are lost when the ball drains. On harder settings, solidly lit cards by downgrade into flashing cards following a drain, meaning those cards must be re-locked in.</p>

<p>The jackpot win rate can be preset to between 5% and 30%. If this is on, player input for the jackpot is largely irrelevant. If this setting is set to Normal, the randomness of the wheel works as you would expect, and players have a 7/16 chance of winning for each of red and black or a 2/16 chance of winning for picking green. This seems to only affect Jackpot Roulette, with the standard 100-chip roulette mode always playing fairly and randomly.</p>
