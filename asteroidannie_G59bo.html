<h1 style="color:red;">Asteroid Annie and the Aliens (Gottlieb, 1980)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Complete the top lanes to light all four suits- the outer two are tied together, and so are the inner two. Then, shoot drop targets until both royal flushes are accounted for. After that, aim for the 15,000 point left orbit with the right flipper, and either the lit spinner or the lower right saucer with the left flipper.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>Score 5,000 points. Going through a lane with a lit suit will unlight it. The spade and heart in the outer lanes form a pair; the club and diamond in the inner lanes also form a pair. Collecting a suit also collects the suit it is paired with. </p>

<h3>Upper left standup target</h3>

<p>Scores 5,000 points. If both banks of drop targets have been completed at least once, this target will toggle whether or not it is lit for an extra ball with every 10-point switch hit.</p>

<h3>Drop targets and side lane features</h3>

<p>There are two different 5-banks of targets. The left bank has the Ace, Queen, and 10 in black, and the King and Jack in red. The right bank has the opposite, with Ace, Queen, and 10 being red, and Jack and King being black. Knocking down any target scores 3,000 points and lights any cards in the center of the table that are of the rank and colour of the hit drop target, and of a lit suit. For example, hitting the red Queen target will give the Queen of Hearts if Hearts is lit but not diamonds, but it will give both red queens if hearts and diamonds have both been lit from the top lanes.</p>

<p>The only way to get a bank of targets to reset in case their cards are needed again is to complete that bank of targets. In addition, completing the left bank in a single ball lights the left semi-orbit lane for 15,000 points; completing the right bank in a single ball lights the spinner for 1,000 points per spin; and completing both banks in a single ball lights the upper left standup target for an extra ball alternately on 10-point switch hits.</p>

<h3>Lower right saucer</h3>

<p>The saucer scores 5,000 points, plus an additional 5,000 for each suit that has had its Ace-through-10 royal flush completed. If all four have been completed, this saucer awards a special in addition to the 25,000 points. If the return feed is safe and the spinner doesn't spin well, plug this shot instead of the lit spinner if at least two royal flushes have been completed.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>The left side is a conventional in/out lane setup where the out lane scores 10,000 points and the in lane scores 5,000. The right side of the table bottom has only one lane that is cut off at the bottom. The lane scores 10,000 points, and to save the ball, it must be nudged off a small post and onto what would otherwise be an in lane rail. Conversely, take caution holding up the right flipper to catch a ball, lest the ball roll up this rail and fall through the gap in the broken in lane.</p>

<h3>End of ball bonus</h3>

<p>The end of ball bonus consists only of 10,000 points for each royal flush completed. Collected cards are carried over from ball to ball unless all 4 royal flushes have been completed, in which case all cards reset. There is no way to multiply the bonus.</p>
