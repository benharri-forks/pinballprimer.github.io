<h1>Creature from the Black Lagoon (Bally Williams, 1992)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick tournament strategies</h2>

<p>Determine if the feed out of the pop bumpers can be easily trapped on the right flipper or dead bounced over to the left. If it can, consider going for a center shot all day strategy. This is an excellent strategy for decent reliable points, especially if you can consistently complete Move Your Car. If that feed is not reliable, play for multiball by:</p>
<ul>
	<li>completing F-I-L-M at the left Kiss lane, snackbar targets, top Paid lanes, and right Slide lane;</li>
	<li>locking a ball at either the Kiss or Slide lanes;</li>
	<li>shooting the side lanes or Snackbar until the Creature is found;</li>
	<li>shooting the Snackbar to rescue the girl;</li>
	<li>shooting the Snackbar again for Jackpot;</li>
	<li>hitting pop bumpers until Super Jackpot is lit;</li>
	<li>collecting Super Jackpot at the snackbar;</li>
	<li>repeat.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Left (Kiss) lane</h3>

<p>Shooting the left lane awards one letter in the word KISS. Completing KISS lights the F in F-I-L-M toward multiball if the F is not already been earned. Under default settings, the 2nd completion of KISS, as well as every 4th completion after that (6th, 10th, 14th, etc.) lights an extra ball at the center Move Your Car shot.</p>
<p>If the F in F-I-L-M has not been lit yet in the game, a well timed full plunge can spot one, two, three, or all four letters of KISS at once. After the first kiss has been completed, full plunges only spot one Kiss letter regardless of timing.</p>
<p>This lane is one of two places that a ball can be locked to start multiball, and one of the three possible hiding places for the Creature during Multiball.</p>

<h3>Snackbar standup targets</h3>

<p>There are 4 blue standup targets surrounding the Snackbar; two on the left, between the Kiss lane and the left ramp, and two on the right between the Snackbar hole and right ramp. Lighting all 4 targets opens the Snackbar and lights the I in F-I-L-M.</p>
<p>If no Jackpot has been collected during the game so far, shooting the Snackbar when unlit spots one of these targets.</p>
<p>If no Super Jackpot has been collected during the game so far, each hit to the pop bumpers will rotate any lit targets.</p>
<p>During Mega Menu mode, these targets are worth 5,000,000 points each.</p>

<h3>Left ramp</h3>

<p>During normal single ball gameplay, the left ramp starts or advances the Double Feature Combo. The Double Feature Combo starts at 500,000 points, can be repeatedly doubled up to 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 million points by comboing the left ramp further, and is collected by shooting the center Move Your Car lane within a few seconds after making the left ramp.</p>
<p>If Unlimited Millions is running, the left ramp starts at 3,000,000 points, with its value increasing by an additional 3,000,000 each time it is hit within the 30 second time limit. If there is a maximum value, it is at least 30,000,000 points.</p>
<p>During Multiball, a diverter makes this ramp a much steeper shot that will instead travel down the spiral over the playfield and into the cup above the right flipper. The ball will then 'stir the cup', with each revolution awarding a letter in Creature. Finishing Creature advances the playfield multiplier for the rest of multiball up to a maximum of 4X. This multiplier does apply to jackpots. Each individual letter of Creature is also worth 1,000,000 points times the playfield multiplier, or 500,000 points if one ball is still 'stirring' while the other drains.</p>

<h3>Center (Move Your Car) lane</h3>

<p>In normal gameplay, the center lane counts up toward starting the Move Your Car mode and sends the ball into the Paid lanes. If somehow the ball bounces to the left of the Paid lanes and ends up coming down the left side, a Sneak-In award of 1,000,000 points is given. The DMD will show how many more center shots are required to start Move Your Car. The first Move Your Car takes 5 shots; starting Move Your Car after that requires 8 shots if the center lane was hit at least once in the previous Move Your Car, or 3 shots if not.</p>
<p>Move Your Car consists of 4 shots. The first is a hurry-up that begins at 8,000,000 points and decreases by about 75,000 points every 1/3 second until the center shot is hit again, which locks in the value. From there, a 16 second timer is started during which the center shot must be hit three more times; those three shots are worth 2X, 3X, and 4X the locked-in value. The total value of Move Your Car, then, is 10X the locked-in value, or a maximum of 80,000,000 points.<br>Both the initial hurry-up and the 16 second timer are paused if the game thinks the ball is in the pop bumpers.</p>
<p>When Extra Ball or Double Feature Combo is lit, it is collected at this lane.</p>

<h3>Snackbar scoop</h3>

<p>If the Snackbar is not open, hitting this scoop will just make the ball pop out of the return above the right in lane. The Snackbar is lit/opened by hitting the four Snackbar standup targets. A Snackbar target will also be spotted if the player has not collected a Jackpot during the game so far.</p>
<p>If the Snackbar is open, this scoop starts a mystery award, which can light an Extra Ball, award a Special, spot one of the F-I-L-M letters, or give food worth minor points.</p>
<p>Shots to the Snackbar after the I in F-I-L-M is lit and the mystery has been redeemed but before multiball is started award Snackbar Score worth 1,100,000 points and increasing by 100,000 each time it is hit.</p>
<p>If Snack Attack is started at the right ramp, a hurry-up initially worth 20,000,000 points and decreasing by 100,000 every 1/3 second can be collected at this scoop.</p>
<p>During multiball, the Snackbar is one of the three locations where the Creature can be hiding. Once the Creature is found, the Girl can be rescued at the Snackbar. Once the Girl is rescued, the Jackpot is scored at the Snackbar. After Jackpot is scored and enough pop bumpers are hit, Super Jackpot is also lit and scored at the Snackbar.<br>If one ball is drained during multiball before a Jackpot is collected, the Snackbar will also restart the multiball if hit within 15 seconds after the other ball drained.</p>

<h3>Paid lanes</h3>
<p>The Paid lanes are conventional pinball upper lanes. Going through a lane lights it. Lit lanes can be rotated in either direction with flipper lane change. Completing the Paid lanes lights the L in F-I-L-M, and either awards a bonus multiplier boost or 5,000,000 points.</p>
<p>Note that the bonus multiplier is additive, and the multiplier you will observe at the end of the ball is the sum of the awards shown. The maximum bonus multiplier is 2+4+6+8+10 = 30X. If 10X has already been awarded, the Paid lanes award 5,000,000 points, which is nothing to sneeze at.</p>
<p>A skill shot is available by plunging the ball directly into whichever of the Paid lanes is flashing. Doing so awards the L in F-I-L-M and the 2X bonus multiplier straight away. However, the skill shot cannot be lane-changed, so it's almost always better to full plunge and go for free Kiss letters instead.</p>

<h3>Pop bumpers</h3>
<p>The Jackpot starts at 40,000,000 points, and increases slightly with every pop bumper hit. Collecting a Super Jackpot doubles the value of all regular Jackpots unless the regular Jackpot value is already greater than 500,000,000. <br>Hitting enough pop bumpers also lights the Super Jackpot after the regular Jackpot is collected; the first Super Jackpot is lit by 30 pop bumpers, and each subsequent Super Jackpot takes 30 more pop hits than the previous.</p>

<h3>Right ramp</h3>
<p>The right ramp takes several hits to do much of anything. Luckily, it can be hit from either flipper.</p>
<p>4 ramps shots starts Snack Attack, a one-time hurry-up collected at the Snackbar hole worth up to 20,000,000 points.</p>
<p>8 ramp shots lights the Peeping Tom video mode at the right Slide lane.</p>
<p>12 ramp shots starts Super Scoring, the closest thing to an everything-is-lit mode or wizard mode as this game has, which consists of Mega Menu, Unlimited Millions, and Big Millions starting simultaneously. </p>
<p>When Big Millions is running, the first shot to the right ramp is worth 5,000,000 points, and each subsequent shot within the 20 seconds is worth an additional 5,000,000. Big Millions is potentially worth more than Unlimited Millions (the corresponding mode for the left ramp), but runs for less time.</p>

<h3>Right (Slide) lane</h3>
<p>Any shot to this lane awards the M in F-I-L-M. If the M is already lit, this shot starts Mega Menu (see Snackbar standup targets), Unlimited Millions (see Left ramp), or Big Millions (see Right ramp), in order.</p>
<p>Video Mode, which is lit by the 8th right ramp shot, is lit and started here.</p>
<p>This lane is one of two places that a ball can be locked to start multiball, and one of the three possible hiding places for the Creature during Multiball.</p>

<h3>Video mode</h3>
<p>To complete the video mode, knock out the Peeping Tom by punching with the flippers. Do this by alternating two left punches and one right punch, in rhythm.</p>

<h3>Fun with F-I-L-M</h3>
<p>The Double F-I-L-M Letter Combo can be awarded by collecting two F-I-L-M letters in quick succession. I have only gotten this to occur by collecting the F in F-I-L-M from the full plunge timed skill shot, followed by one-timing the ball into the Slide lane to instantly pick up the M. Doing so awarded 4,000,000 points on top of the values for the F-I-L-M letters themselves. It may be possible to do this under other circumstances or for other values.</p>
<p>There is also a Sequential F-I-L-M Award of 8,000,000 points available for, as the name suggests, collecting F, I, L, and M in order. However, this award has been seen by players that collected the letters in the order F, L, I, M. It is possible that, at least in some ROM versions, the game only checks that you collected the F first and the M last.</p>
