<h1 style="text-align:center">Sinbad / Eye of the Tiger (Gottlieb, 1978)</h1>

<p>Sinbad has both 4-player solid state and 4-player electromechanical versions. Eye of the Tiger is a 2-player electromechanical version. This guide was written with the solid state version in mind. Differences in the electromechanical versions are discussed at the end of the guide.</p>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>
<p>Hit drop targets! Bonus X depends on completing banks of drop targets in order, so make sure you hit the whites and yellows. Don't scissor drain.</p>


<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Drop targets</h3>
<p>All drop targets are worth 3,000 points and advance the bonus.</p>
<p>The white target lites the left standup target, the standup near the bumpers, and the rightmost top lane for 1,000 points each, as well as lighting 2X bonus.</p>
<p>Completing the yellow targets lights the lower right side lane, the out lanes, and the third top lane from the left for 5,000 points each (they are normally worth 500). It also lights 3X bonus, <i>but only if the white target has also been knocked down.</i></p>
<p>Completing the purple targets lights the second top lane from the left for extra ball, in addition to its usual 1,000 points. It also lights 4X bonus, <i>but only if the white target AND both yellow targets are down.</i></p>
<p>Completing the red targets lights the leftmost top lane for special in addition to its usual 5,000 points. It also lights 5X bonus, <i>but only if all of the white, yellow, and purple targets are all down.</i></p>
<p>If, for example, you complete the yellow targets before the white, but then go back and knock down the white, you will jump straight from 1X bonus to 3X. This works for jumping straight to 4X or 5X as well if you complete the purple or red before completing every target below them.</p>
<p>When all targets are knocked down, they will all reset, with their value increased from 3,000 each to 5,000. The bonus will also automatically count down and drain, allowing the player to build it up again with more targets. (It is possible for the base bonus to exceed 10,000, since the spinner can also advance bonus.) It is not possible for the bonus X to exceed 5X, but the targets can reset again with another mid-ball bonus cash-in if all targets are knocked down a second time. That last bit is pretty much impossible. </p>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>
<p>For simplicity, I will refer to the lanes as 1, 2, 3, and 4, from left to right. <br>Lane 1 is always worth 5,000, with a Special thrown in if it is lit by completing the red drop targets.<br>Lane 2 is always worth 1,000, with an extra ball thrown in if it is lit by completing the purple targets.<br>Lane 3 is worth 500 when unlit, or 5,000 when lit, and is lit by completing the yellow targets.<br>Lane 4 is worth 100 when unlit, or 1,000 when lit, and is lit by hitting the white target.</p>
<p>On the plunge, the only ways to be sure to avoid a house ball are to go in lane 4 and take the measly 100 points, or avoid the top lanes entirely and come down the left side for a feed to one of the right flippers.  </p>
<p>The only reliable way to get back to the top lanes is through the left side lane, but this is a very difficult shot. It might be better to just shoot up the spinner or next to the red targets, hope for good pop bumper luck, and nudge to get the lane you want, if ever you want to get a prize from the top lanes.</p>

<h3>Spinner</h3>
<p>The spinner, lodged between the yellow and purple targets, advances the bonus every 5th spin. It's not a bad thing if you hit it, but going for any drop targets that are left is pretty much always preferred. Be careful about immediate returns through the spinner off a bumper if a shot hits the spinner.</p>

<h3>Flippers</h3>
<p>There are double flippers on both sides of the playfield, and no in lanes. It is possible to scissor drain between the flippers on both sides. Be very careful about holding the flipper up for too long when the ball is near the inner flippers. Trapping up on the outer flippers is possible, though, and can even be a good idea to more safely hit the white, purple, or red targets. </p>

<h3>Differences in the electromechanical versions of the game</h3>

<p>On Sinbad EM and Eye of the Tiger, the only bonus multiplier is 2x. This is award by completing the white, yellow, and purple drop targets. Those targets score 500 points each; only the red drop targets score 3,000 points each.</p>

<p>The bonus is not automatically collected if you knock down every drop target in the game, and drop targets never reset mid-ball.</p>

<p>Only some of the yellow features are lit at a time. Pop bumpers alternate whether the left out lane and yellow top lane are lit, or the right side lane and right out lane are lit.</p>

<p>The game has 5 score reels and a 100,000 light rather than a full 6 digit display.</p>
