<h1 style="text-align:center">Algar (Williams, 1980)</h1>

<p>Not to be confused with Gorgar (Williams, 1979).</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>From the left flipper, shoot for captive balls. From the right flipper, shoot the River Styx loop shot in the center, unless all 3 captive balls have been made, in which case you should shoot the blue arrow toward the top left kicker to reset the captive balls. Clear one bank of drop targets to double the next River Styx shot's value, clear both banks of drop targets for an increasing award and eventually extra ball.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top of the table</h3>

<p>The four top lanes each correspond to letter in the word Kora, and score 1,000 points and a bonus advance. Roll through an unlit lane to light it. Lane change with the right flipper only can be used to move which lanes are lit. Spelling Kora advances the bonus multiplier toward its maximum of 5x. The top saucer in between the O and R lanes scores no points directly, but it spots one Kora letter for you and opens the gate in the far right out lane, which deflects a ball back to the shooter lane for a replunge. </p>

<h3>Drop targets</h3>

<p>Drop targets start out flashing. Hit a flashing drop target to light it solidly. Each drop target down scores 5,000 points and a bonus advance when flashing, or only 1,000 points when solidly lit. Completing either 3-bank of targets scores 5,000 points, resets that bank of targets, and lights the River Styx loop shot for 2x value. Completing both drop target banks to light all 6 arrows scores and advances the current drop target bonus value, in the sequence 10,000 - 30,000 - 50,000 - 100,000. Advancing this value to the point where the next completion of both banks would score 100,000 points also lights the top saucer for an extra ball. Lit drop target arrows are remembered from ball to ball, but the actual banks themselves are reset for the start of each turn.</p>

<h3>River Styx loop shot</h3>

<p>A hard shot to the River Styx lane, whose entrance is just to the right of the center drop targets, will take a hard left turn, go through the far left in lane, and come to the left flipper very quickly. This scores and advances the River Styx value, which starts at 10,000 points and increases 10,000 at a time up to a maximum of 60,000 points. Completing either 3-bank of drop targets wil light the River Styx loop shot for double scoring, after which the 2x light goes out. The ball can enter the far left in lane on its own rather than being directed there by a shot to the proper River Styx entrance; this will still score the Styx value, but it will not advance the value, and it will not double the value even if the 2x shot was lit. The River Styx value is preserved from ball to ball, unless you tilt at any time, in which case the value will be reset to 10,000 points for your next ball. Making one River Styx shot on a ball lights the spinners for 1,000 points per spin; only one spinner is lit at a time, and which side is lit will alternate every 5 seconds. Making a River Styx shot for the full base value of 60,000 points lights the out lanes alternately for a special.</p>

<h3>Captive balls</h3>

<p>There are three captive balls on the right side of the game. When a captive ball is hit and the target at the end of the lane is registered, the ball will be held at the end of the lane. Captive balls are only released to be hit again by following the blue arrow between the two drop target banks and getting a ball to land in the kicker lane at the top left of the table. A wacky bounce to the left out of the bumpers can also cause the ball to end up here. The first captive ball hit scored during a ball in play scores 30,000 points; the second scores 40,000; any further hits after that score 50,000 each. This is the fastest route to quick scoring in the game, but it's also the most dangerous, because it's common for a ball to hit a captive ball, lose all momentum, and drop straight down into the near right out lane.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Algar has a very unique bottom of table. On the left, starting at the flipper and moving outward, there is a flipper; a normal slingshot; a conventional in lane, which scores 1,000 points and spots a Kora letter; an out lane, which scores 5,000 points and special when lit; and finally, at the left edge of the table is the exit to the River Styx, which scores as described above and crosses over with the out lane, goes through a one way gate, and comes to the left flipper. On the right, starting at the flipper and moving outwards, there is a flipper' a slingshot directly behind the flipper hinge; an out lane, which scores 5,000 points and special when lit; another slingshot; and finally, the far right out lane, which scores 1,000 points and spots a Kora letter, and also has a gate which can be opened by the top saucer and closes once used, which directs the ball back to the shooter lane.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is advanced by Kora top lanes, flashing drop targets, the near left in lane, or the far right out lane. Bonus multiplier is advanced by completing Kora. Max bonus is 5x 29,000 = 145,000 points. Base bonus is never carried from ball to ball. Bonus multiplier is always carried from ball to ball, but only if the multiplier has NOT been maxed out at 5x; in that case, it will reset back to 1x. There is no mid ball bonus collect.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>In competition/novelty play, specials score 50,000 points. Extra balls cannot have a point value. Game settings determine whether there is a limit of 1 extra ball per ball in play or not.</p>

<p>The drop target clear value, River Styx value, and bonus multiplier can all independently have their ball to ball memory disabled.</p>
