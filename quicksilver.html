<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Go for Quicksilver letters. The end of ball bonus is actually the sum of the lit inserts in the center of the table, not just a simple count. The right bank advances bonus X for the whole game. Clearing the left bank spots a letter, and the left saucer increases the value of each individual target of the left bank.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Quicksilver letters</h3>
<p>Eleven lights around the playfield: QUIC are the top lanes, K is in the lower right, SIL are to the left of the bumpers, and VER are to the right of the bumpers. Each one advances the bonus wheel in the center of the table. It looks like the bonus lights simply count off 1,000 at a time, but the bonus awarded is actually the sum of all lit values; 2 letters = 1K + 2K = 3,000, 3 letters = 1K + 2K + 3K = 6,000, etc. The 11th letter is worth an additional 20,000 instead of 11,000, making the total bonus 75,000. Achieving this also holds the bonus over for one ball. Completing the left 4-bank of drop targets spots one letter.</p>

<h3>Left saucer and left drop targets</h3>
<p>The left drop targets are initially worth 1,000 each. Completing this bank spots one letter in Quicksilver. The left saucer scores 5,000 points directly and also advances the value of each individual drop target in the left bank to the indicated value on the table: first to 5,000, then to 10,000, then 15,000, and finally 20,000 <i>per drop</i>. <br>The drops seem to be at an odd angle, but they are positioned in such a way that hitting them from either flipper will redirect the ball into the left orbit/left spinner. Be prepared for the return in either direction if you miss the bank, though, especially from the right flipper.</p>

<h3>In lanes and spinners</h3>
<p>The spinners are normally worth 200 points per spin. In lane rollovers light the opposite spinner to be worth 2,000 points per spin for one single rip. Be sure that you don't intentionally shoot for a lit spinner that is still swinging, as this could mean that you only get credit for one spin while it's lit.</p>

<h3>Right drop targets</h3>
<p>The 3-bank of drop targets on the right advance the bonus multiplier when completed. Bonus X carries over from ball to ball for the entire game, so while it's important to shoot for at all times, but even more so at the beginning of the game. <br>Completing the bank again after reaching 5X bonus awards a special.</p>

<h3>Pop bumpers</h3>
<p>Pop bumpers score 1,000 points each. <br>It's fairly common for a ball to bounce off the left or right sides repeatedly and knock out multiple letters from the left SIL or right VER sets. The top QUIC lanes will probably be the last letters you get, unless you go for a lot of left target banks.</p>
