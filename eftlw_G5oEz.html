<h1 style="color:forestgreen;">Escape from the Lost World (Bally Midway, 1988)</h1>

<p>Not to be confused with Lost World (Bally, 1978) or The Lost World: Jurassic Park (Sega, 1997).</p>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Pretty much the only things to do in the game are build the Treasure Bonus and collect the Treasure Bonus. To build the Treasure Bonus, complete banks of targets on the lowest playfield or shoot into the Volcano cave in the upper-rightmost part of the top playfield. To collect the Treasure Bonus, complete the lowest playfield's drop targets, then combo your way up to the top playfield: shoot the left ramp or the saucer between the left ramp and the bumpers, then use the upper left flipper to cross the bridge, then use the upper right flipper to put the ball in the very back of the game. Multiball is meaningless, don't make it a strategy.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Building Treasure Bonus</h3>

<p>Your Treasure Bonus always starts at 100,000 points. The following items increase your Treasure Bonus toward the maximum of 2,500,000 points.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Complete the 3-bank standup targets in the lower left: 30,000 treasure bonus</li>
	<li>Complete the 5-bank standup targets in the lower right: 50,000 treasure bonus</li>
	<li>Access the upper left flipper (via the left ramp or the saucer shot between the left ramp and the bumper): 50,000 treasure bonus</li>
	<li>Star rollover in the Volcano Cave near the upper right flipper: 100,000 treasure bonus</li>
	<li>Mountain switch hit by making a full shot around the back of the game with the upper right flipper: 100,000 treasure bonus</li>
</ul>

<h3>Collecting Treasure Bonus</h3>

<p>Complete the 3-bank of drop targets in the center of the bottom playfield to open the Escape gate for 30 seconds. Now, you want to make your way to the top back of the upper playfield. Get the ball on the lower right flipper and shoot the left ramp or the saucer behind the bumpers to get the ball to the upper left flipper. Shoot across the gold bridge, then be ready to use the upper right flipper to whack the ball around back of the game into the Escape doorway, whose gate is now open. This scores your entire Treasure bonus and resets it to 100,000, and starts an instant multiball.</p>

<h3>Multiball</h3>

<p>Multiball is pretty pointless. There is no increased scoring or any kind of multiball jackpot. All you get is two balls on the playfield that can sometimes hit more targets and build your Treasure Bonus up faster. There are three ways to start multiball:</p>
<ul>
	<li>collect the Treasure Bonus</li>
	<li>collect 3 Multiball Memories by shooting the saucer on the right side of the lowest playfield and having it pop the ball onto the brown ramp that directs it to the right in lane</li>
	<li>have the ball go down the left out lane in such a way that it bounces through the gap in the left side and into a lane even further left that, which starts multiball because that's where the ball ends up after you escape</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other miscellaneous scoring</h3>

<p>Drop targets and lit standup targets score 10,000 points. Unlit standup targets score 1,000 points. The saucer behind the bumpers scores 25,000 points. Bumpers and the slingshot near the bumpers always score 1,000 points. Completing a set of Golden standup targets scores the same points as it adds to the Treasure Bonus (30,000 for 3-bank or 50,000 for 5-bank). The Volcano tunnel and Mountain path score 50,000 points.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>In lanes on Escape from the Lost World are slanted outward, so one lane kinda splits into two halfway down. It may take more nudging than usual to get a ball to go in lane instead of out lane, especially on the right. For the left out lane specifically, there is always the chance of knocking the ball into the partially hidden multiball start on the far left side.</p>

<p>Lit in lanes score 25,000 points and unlight when rolled through. Relight the inlanes by hitting the slingshot (!?) on the same side.</p>

<h3>End of ball bonus</h3>

<p>Individual standup and drop targets score 2 bonus advances. Completing a set of the Golden targets scores 4 bonus advances. Completing the drop targets scores 6 bonus advances. In lanes score 3 bonus advances. The Volcano tunnel and the Mountain path around the back of the game each score 5 bonus advances. Max bonus is 511,000 points and cannot be multiplied. There is no mid-ball bonus collect. To hold bonus for the next ball, shoot the saucer behind the bumpers a number of times: 2 times on the first ball of the game, 3 times on the second ball of the game, etc.</p>
