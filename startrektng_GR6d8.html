<h1>Star Trek: The Next Generation (Bally Williams, 1993)</h1>

<p>Not to be confused with other tables based on the Star Trek franchise or containing a similar name: Star Trek (Gottlieb, 1971), Star Trek (Bally, 1979), Star Trek (Data East, 1991), or Star Trek Enterprise/Vengeance/Starfleet (Stern Pinball, 2013/2018).</p>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Master the Picard maneuver, which is a combo of left orbit -> side ramp. This gets you Warp Factors to light other things on the playfield, big increasing millions during Warp 9, and is a guaranteed triple jackpot during Borg Multiball. A good strategy is to Picard maneuver whenever the ball is on the right flipper, and shoot the right orbit to light or score locks if the ball is ever on the left flipper.<br>It's not too difficult to advance to Final Frontier wizard mode by playing and timing out the 7 basic modes, but Final Frontier has very low value unless you're able to play the modes will enough to collect crystals along the way. This turns the actual game progression into a long term investment that's not recommended unless you're sure that the machine you're playing on gives out long ball times.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Skill shot</h3>

<p>The DMD rotates between 5 skill shot options. The lit item will move every couple seconds, or you can force the cursor to move with the flippers. Shoot the gun launcher to collect the currently highlighted option. The five choices are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Start Mission: the ball will be launched into the back hole, and the currently flashing mode will start. If all 7 modes have been played, you can start Final Frontier wizard mode off the plunge with this option.</li>
	<li>Flipper Skill Shot: the ball will eventually be sent to the left flipper. You have about 10 seconds to shoot the right ramp for the value listed on the screen. Awards include 10,000,000 points, Advance Rank, Double Spinner, Light Kickback, Light Extra Ball, Instant Extra Ball/Special. Not worth ever going for.</li>
	<li>Launch Probe: the right playfield gun is loaded and you need to hit the lit shot. If you do, you score...points? 25,000,000? Maybe other things? All I know is that it's even less worth trying for than the Flipper Skill Shot.</li>
	<li>Light Lock: a free lock toward multiball, and 10,000,000 points. If two balls are already locked, this will be replaced with Light Holodeck instead, which gives you a chance at video mode with the next right orbit shot. A setting exists that limits the number of skill shot locks to 1 per multiball; if you've already used that lock, this option will be replaced with Advance Multiplier (bonus X).</li>
	<li>Warp Factor 4: instantly starts you at Warp 4. What this means is explained in the Warp Factors section below. If you've already advanced to Warp 9 once in the game, this option is replaced by Warp 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're playing for Picard maneuvers and multiball, go for Warp Factor 4 or Light Lock. If you're playing for mode progression, definitely take Start Mission. Never choose the other two.</p>

<h3>"Missions": main modes, Artifacts, and Final Frontier wizard mode</h3>

<p>There are 7 main mission modes in the game, with Final Frontier wizard mode being qualified after all 7 are played. There are three ways to start a mode: the Start Mission skill shot, the center scoop in the back of the game, and the Command Decision hole just above the side ramp when lit. The skill shot and the center scoop start the currently flashing mission; this is rotated by bumper hits or shots to the Q target just to the left of the right ramp. The lit Command Decision hole lets you pick any of the 7 modes to play; you can even use this to rerun a mode that has already been played to take advantage of its scoring again or collect more Artifacts. <br>The 7 modes are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Time Rift:</b> the timer starts at 20 seconds. Any shot in the game with an emblem in front of it scores 10,000,000 points. Hit either of the Time Rift targets in the near left to add 5 seconds to clock. The first three hits to either Time Rift target also increase the shot value by 5,000,000 each, up to a maximum of 25,000,000 points. Make a total of 5 shots to collect the artifact.</li>
	<li><b>Worm Hole:</b> the timer is 20 seconds and cannot be increased. This is a count-up round of sorts. The mode value starts at 30,000,000 points. Right ramp shots increase the mode value by 10,000,000. Spinner shots increase the mode value by 1,000,000 per spin. Making the side ramp collects the mode value and ends the mode successfully, scoring an artifact.</li>
	<li><b>Search the Galaxy:</b> a 40 second mode. The three ramps score 10,000,000, then 20,000,000, then 30,000,000. Hit all three within the time and you will receive one artifact. If you hit the three ramps in the order that the game asks you to- alpha (center) first, then beta (right), then delta (side)- you will get the chance to shoot the Neutral Zone in the back left to complete the mode, scoring 50,000,000 points and a second artifact.</li>
	<li><b>Battle Simulation:</b> a 20 second mode, but the timer pauses frequently. Shoot any hole- right orbit, Start Mission, the Neutral Zone, or Command Decision- and one of the playfield guns will be loaded. Shoot into the lit shot to score and advance the current value- 10,000,000 the first time, increasing by 10,000,000 each time up to 50,000,000 for the 5th shot, then the 6th shot awards 100,000,000 points and an extra ball. Making the 5th shot scores an artifact. The timer doesn't run when a playfield gun is loaded; the timer is really just there to penalize you for the time taken to get the ball back into a hole after a missed shot. That said, though, missed shots with the playfield guns are very difficult to get back into control due to their speed off of a post, so this mode is the easiest one to justify timing out.</li>
	<li><b>Q's Challenge:</b> a number of shots (usually 3 to start) will be lit. Hit a lit shot, and a random different shot will light in its place. Hit the Q target to add one more lit shot. The first lit shot scores 10,000,000 points; subsequent lit shots score 10,000,000 more than the previous, up to a maximum of 100,000,000. If a shot is lit for 15 seconds and is not made, it will time out. The mode does not end until all shots time out (or the ball drains). If you shoot the left orbit or the side ramp- the two halves of the Picard maneuver- the other Picard shot will always be the one to light up. Thus, you can score hundreds of millions or even billions of points from this mode if you can make Picard maneuvers repeatedly. This is absolutely the most lucrative mode in the game, outside of a souped-up Final Frontier. Making a total of 5 lit shot scores the artifact.</li>
	<li><b>Rescue:</b> a 30 second frenzy mode of sorts. Any switch hit scores 1,000,000 points and adds a person to the shuttle. The center or right ramp rescues all of the people currently on the shuttle, scoring 1,000,000 each again. Shooting the Start Mission hole instantly rescues 5 people and scores 10,000,000 points. Rescue 25 people to collect the artifact (people that are sitting on the shuttle when the mode times out count toward the 25). Rescue 50 people before time runs out to score 50,000,000 points and instantly end the mode.</li>
	<li><b>Asteroid Threat:</b> the ball is fed to the left flipper and a 20,000,000 point hurry-up begins. Shoot the Start Mission hole to collect and lock in the currently displayed value. Then, a 30 second timer starts and all 7 emblem shots around the game will light up, and each one is worth the locked-in value. Hit any three of the seven shots to earn an Artifact. Hit all 7 to end the mode with an instant 50,000,000 point bonus. If you failed to collect the hurry-up, the 7 shots phase will still happen, with all shots being worth a default 5,000,000 points.</li>
</ul>
<p>Artifacts can be collected by doing well in modes as described above, or by reaching Warp Factor 8 or completing the video mode, which are described in later sections. Receiving an artifact is always worth 50,000,000 points. When you complete all 7 modes, the next mode start will be Final Frontier wizard mode, whose value depends on the number of artifacts you collected.<br>Just for starting Final Frontier, you receive 100,000,000 points for every artifact collected, as well as 1,000,000,000 points for each set of the 4 artifacts you have completed. The maximum number of artifacts you can collect is 40- do this, and you will receive 14,000,000,000 points just for starting Final Frontier! A more reasonable startup bonus is around 3,000,000,000, though. After you are paid off for your artifacts, a 6-ball multiball begins where every shot in the game scores 25,000,000 points times the number of artifacts you've collected, maxing out at 250,000,000 per shot at 10 artifacts. If you manage to start Final Frontier with <i>zero</i> artifacts, all shots will be worth a measly 10,000,000. I have no strategy with this multiball other than just shoot stuff! Keep balls in play and rack up the big points for as long as possible. When single ball play resumes, all modes will unlight, and you can make the run again. If you advance to Final Frontier multiple times, the game looks at all the artifacts you've collected over the course of the game, not just the ones collected since the previous Final Frontier you played in that game.</p>

<h3>Warp Factor</h3>

<p>At the start of each ball, you will be at Warp 1. The right in lane lights the left orbit/spinner shot for Advance Warp. If you have not yet achieved Warp 9 in the game so far, the side ramp is also a guaranteed Advance Warp. One of the Skill Shot options allows you to start at Warp 4 (or 2) as well. Each warp comes with its own award:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The starting level.</li>
	<li>5,000,000 points.</li>
	<li>Super Jets: 1,000,000 points per bumper for the rest of the ball.</li>
	<li>Spinner is lit: for 10x value for the rest of the ball, meaning a minimum of 100,000 per spin.</li>
	<li>Bonus Multiplier is held to the next ball.</li>
	<li>In lanes are lit: the left in lane is lit for a hurry-up at the right ramp worth up to 50,000,000 points, and the right in lane is lit for Super Spinner, which sets the spinner value to 10,000,000 per spin. The hurry-up is one-time-use, but the Super Spinner's timer can be reset if you go through the right in lane quickly enough. The most reliable way to do this is to turn a Super Spinner shot into a Picard maneuver, which feeds the right in lane. The more times you re-up the Super Spinner, the faster it tries time out, and eventually it'll disappear with no chance to be recovered.</li>
	<li>Double spinner: spinner value is doubled. Not sure if this continues to apply if Super Spinner is active.</li>
	<li>Awards an extra ball. If extra balls are off, or if this extra ball has already been collected, you get an artifact instead.</li>
	<li>Starts Warp 9 mode. In this mode, you have 10 seconds to shoot the left orbit or side ramp. Do so to advance your warp factor by 0.1. Reaching warp 9.1 scores 20,000,000 points; 9.2 scores an additional 25,000,000; this pattern continues until 9.9, scoring 60,000,000 points. You have 10 seconds to make each shot, except for the 9.9 shot, which gives 20 seconds. If you reach 9.9 or the time runs out, you reset to warp 1 (but everything listed as "for the rest of the ball" stays around).</li>
</ol>

<h3>Borg Multiball</h3>

<p>Light the lock by shooting the right orbit. Lock a ball at the right orbit or the side ramp when lock is lit. You can also light a lock or lock a ball with a skill shot choice. The third lock must be done at the right orbit specifically.<br>Multiball starts by loading the left probe gun with a ball. You must shoot the ball into the Start Mission hole to increase the jackpot value by 10,000,000 points. After three such shots, or if you miss on any of them, two other balls get kicked out and multiball begins. The jackpot value starts at 20,000,000 points; it is raised slightly with each bumper hit in addition to the opening probe shots. The Start Mission scoop is the jackpot shot: hit it repeatedly to cycle between single, double, and triple jackpots. Occasionally, the Start Mission scoop will unlight; hit the Spinner to reload your ship's shields and light the jackpot again. The more spins are registered, the longer it will take for the jackpot to unlight again. The side ramp cares not for these shenanigans and is always available for a triple jackpot at any point during the multiball. <br>Spinner and side ramp...sound familiar? If you can continue to hit Picard maneuvers during multiball, you can constantly pick off triple jackpots and always have the center scoop available for when other balls are parked elsewhere.</p>

<h3>Neutral Zone side modes</h3>

<p>Hit any Neutral Zone target 3 times, then shoot into the exposed Neutral Zone hole to start one of these modes. They're pretty forgettable and don't fold well into any strong strategy for this game, but here they are anyway:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Ferengi: the right playfield gun is loaded. Shoot any neutral zone target to add a ball to the playfield, then hit neutral zone more within 10 seconds to keep adding balls, up to a max of 4. The Ferengi jackpot starts at 10,000,000, is increased by 2,000,000 every time a yellow standup target in the lower left of the game is hit, is multiplied by the number of balls in play, and is collected at the Start Mission scoop in the center.</li>
	<li>Romulan: a 40 second mode. Shoot the spinner, center ramp, or right ramp to cloak a ship and score 10,000,000 points. A cloaked ship (on the DMD) will uncloak after about 15 seconds. Cloak all three ships at the same time to score 30,000,000 points and end the mode. Hit the yellow standup targets in the lower right for Klingon Assistance, which blocks one of the ships for you.</li>
	<li>Cardassian: a 2-ball multiball. Hit the Neutral Zone targets to score the jackpot. Jackpots start at 50,000,000 points and decrease over time as the Enterprise's shields take damage. The jackpot can fall as low as 5,000,000 points. Hit the spinner to refresh the shields and bring the value back up. You can continue collecting jackpots until one ball drains.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Holodeck and video mode</h3>

<p>The 3rd right ramp shot, then every 6th after that (9, 15, 21, 27, etc.), lights the right orbit for Holodeck. Make this shot and you will have two options: instant 25,000,000, or Shuttle Simulator video mode.</p>

<p>In Shuttle Simulator, use the flippers to move left or right. Collect the squares with 10s on them for 10,000,000 points each. Avoid the spiked bombs. Every so often, the tunnel will split into a left and right path, and if you're in the center of the screen when this happens, you will crash and lose. At the end of the 9th cavern, you will receive an Artifact. The video mode is the same every time, and most high level players always follow this pattern for when the path splits: L-L-R-R-L-L-R-L-L-L. A perfect play of this pattern awards 159,000,000 points plus an Artifact (or 149,000,000 plus an extra ball and an artifact, if the video mode feels generous). It's always worth going for the video mode when Holodeck is lit, but it can get a little boring and rhythm-breaking after a while.</p>

<h3>Command Decision hole and the rest of the right ramp</h3>

<p>Every 6th right ramp lights Command Decision at the upper left scoop just above the side ramp. Shooting the ball into Command Decision when lit (and when no other mode is running) lets you choose with the flippers which mode to start. You can even pick a mode that you've already played to rerun it, if you want to (for example) get more points from another time through Q's Challenge or get another chance at the two artifacts in Search the Galaxy.</p>

<p>Every 15 right ramps lights an extra ball at the Start Mission hole. 50 and 250 right ramps score a special.</p>

<p>Completing the top lanes above the bumpers advances the bonus multiplier in the order of 2x-4x-8x-10x and lights the Command Decision hole for Advance Rank. You start at Ensign and advance to Lieutenant, Lieutenant Commander, Commander, and Captain. Part of your end of ball bonus is 5,000,000 points times your rank, up to 25,000,000 for a captain. Shooting Advance Rank when you are already a captain scores an instant 100,000,000 points. Each completion of the top lanes when the bonus multiplier is already 10x scores an increasing value, first 10,000,000 and increasing by 10,000,000 each time. Hitting a lit standup target in the lower left or lower right of the game when the left kickback is already lit spots one of the top lanes.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Star Trek: The Next Generation has a conventional in/out lane setup. The left out lane has a kickback that is lit by hitting the lit standup target in the lower left or lower right of the game. The slingshots are unusally shaped and not trianglular, with a flat top that bounces the ball toward the in/out lane area. At Warp 6, both in lanes are lit: hurry-up on the left, and super spinner on the right. On top of the slingshots are playfield guns used in the Battle Simulation and Ferengi modes as well as the multiball start and the Launch Probe skill shot. Owing to the widebody structure of this game, the slingshots are more than usual distance away from the flippers, so post transfers are not very viable for transferring the ball from one flipper to another.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>End of ball bonus is counted as 1,000,000 times the number of Mission modes you played in the game, plus 5,000,000 times your rank, plus 1,000,000 for each Warp you advance on that ball, all times the bonus multiplier. Bonus multiplier is increased by completing top lanes and turns the bonus into a very formidable sum, so don't tilt where possible. Reaching Warp 5 holds your bonus multiplier over to the next ball. There is no mid-ball bonus collect.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>The game manual says that specials score 1,000,000 points in competition/novelty play, which I expect is incorrect as with many 90s Williams manuals. No point value for extra balls is given as an option.</p>

<p>Missions can be set to be able to be run once, never, or an unlimited number of times.</p>

<p>The time that the Neutral zone is open to add balls to Ferengi multiball can be set to between 8 and 20 seconds, default 10.</p>

<p>The number of locks the player may collect from skill shots can be set to 0, 1, 2, or infinite. The setting is ambiguously worded, but I can only imagine that this refers to how many locks you can take from the skill shot per game, rather than per ball or per trip through multiball.</p>
