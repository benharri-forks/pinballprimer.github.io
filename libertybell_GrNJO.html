<h1 style="text-align:center">Liberty Bell (Williams, 1977)</h1>

<p>Not to be confused with Liberty Belle (Gottlieb, 1962).</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Shoot the spinners all day. As the ball comes down from the top of the table, try to nudge it into the top saucer or nudge it around the bumper area to hit both the B and E drop targets. Hitting B+E or L+L once lights the side saucers for double bonus, which is worth picking up. B+E and L+L completions also advance the top saucer value, and 4 completions lights the out lanes alternately for extra ball. Avoid the L+L targets where possible, though, because shooting at them is risky and missing them is even more risky; try to get your completions from B+E.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top saucer</h3>

<p>Scores a bonus advance as well as 500, 5,000, 10,000, 20,000, or 30,000 points, depending on whether 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 stars are lit.</p>

<h3>Drop targets</h3>

<p>B and E are near the bumpers, and L+L are in the center of the table. Each target down scores 1,000 points. If 0 or 1 star(s) are lit, the L+L drop targets also each give 1 bonus advance. Knocking down both B+E or L+L lights a star, which advances the top saucer value. Lighting star 1 lights the side saucers for double bonus. Lighting star 3 or 4 (depending on settings) lights the out lanes alternately for extra ball. </p>

<h3>Spinners</h3>

<p>One of the two spinners is always lit for 1,000 points per spin. The other scores 100 per spin. The lit spinner alternates when any saucer is made or after every 2 bonus advances. 10 spins to a single spinner will also advance the bonus in its own right.</p>

<h3>Side saucers</h3>

<p>Score 500 points in addition to possibly being lit for double bonus. Unlike Grand Prix, these saucers do not collect the bonus.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Liberty Bell has no in lanes. The flippers back up directly to the slingshots. Slingshots score 10 points. Out lanes score 10,000 points and are lit alternately for extra ball after collecting either 3 or 4 stars. The lit out lane is always on the opposite side of the table as the lit spinner.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus advances are given from the top saucer, every 10th spin of a spinner, and the center drop targets when lit. Notice that a single bonus advance is worth 10,000 points in this game rather than the traditional 1,000. Bonus can be doubled by lighting star #1 then shooting either side saucer. Max bonus is 2x 100,000 = 200,000 points, which is a very significant portion of scoring. Try not to tilt if you can help it unless you're on the receiving end of a house ball. There is no bonus holdover or mid-ball bonus collect. Double bonus is not given for free on the final ball of the game.</p>
