<h1 style="color:red;">Funhouse (Bally Williams, 1990)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Bumpers, targets, ramps, and the top scoop all advance the clock time. Advance to 11:30, then lock two balls at the center shot just to the right of the top scoop. At midnight, shoot into Rudy's open mouth with the upper flipper for 1,000,000 points and multiball. During multiball, the trapdoor shot scores Millions-Plus, and the left ramp reopens the trapdoor. To collect Mirror items toward Super Frenzy, light the mirror by hitting Rudy in the jaw or going through the far right in lane.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Skill shot</h3>

<p>The main skill shot is a precise-power plunge that slows up at the top of the table just enough to fall into a hidden saucer behind Rudy's head. The skill shot scores 250,000 the first time, an additional 250,000 subsequent times, and a max of 1,000,000 points.</p>

<p>An alternate plunge strategy is to plunge very lightly so the ball goes through the small lane that "connects" to the far in lane. This small, out of the way lane advances the bumpers (lighting one that is unlit, or if all three are lit, turning a lit bumper into a flashing one).</p>

<h3>Clock time</h3>

<p>At the beginning of the game, the clock is set to 8:00. If multiball has been played already, the clock is set to 5:00. The goal of the clock is to hit enough shots and targets that award minutes to advance the clock all the way to 11:30, when lock is lit at the Hidden Hallway center lane. The following features award clock time:</p>
<ul>
	<li>5 minutes from lit pop bumpers, the blue Step targets, or the Superdog targets in the center of the playfield</li>
	<li>10 minutes from flashing pop bumpers, the Hidden Hallway center shot, or any shot to the Trapdoor loop</li>
	<li>15 minutes from the Wind Tunnel top scoop</li>
	<li>15, then 20, then 25, then 30 minutes from the left ramp</li>
	<li>30 minutes for the Crazy Steps manhole below the pop bumpers that can only be reached with good pop bumper luck</li>
</ul>

<p>At 11:30, the clock can only be advanced by locking a ball in the Hidden Hallway. The first lock moves the clock to 11:45; the second moves the clock to Midnight. At midnight, Rudy falls asleep with his mouth open; shoot the ball into his mouth for 1,000,000 points and multiball.<br>Advancing the clock to 11:30 twice in a single game lights the out lanes alternately for a Special.</p>

<h3>Wind Tunnel top scoop and Mystery Mirror</h3>

<p>If it is not lit, the Wind Tunnel top scoop scores 15 minutes and 10,000 points. It can be lit for Mystery Mirror temporarily by going through the far right in lane, or solidly until collected by hitting Rudy in the jaw during regular gameplay. Making the scoop when the Mirror is lit awards the flashing award, which is rotated by the pop bumpers. The awards are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Light Extra Ball (at the Hidden Hallway)</li>
	<li>Light Million (for the next hit to Rudy)</li>
	<li>Jet Bumpers at Max (all three start flashing)</li>
	<li>Light Superdog (see below)</li>
	<li>Open Crazy Steps (see below)</li>
	<li>Quick Multiball (see below)</li>
</ul>
<p>After collecting all 6 awards, the Mirror will immediately be lit for Super Frenzy. Collecting Super Frenzy locks the Mirror out from giving any more awards for the rest of the ball.</p>

<h3>Left ramp and Steps</h3>

<p>The left ramp scores 15 minutes and 75,000 points the first time it is made. Subsequent shots award 5 more minutes and 25,000 more points, up to a maximum of 30 minutes and 150,000 points. Playing standard Multiball or draining the ball resets the ramp's value. In standard multiball, the ramp scores 250,000 points.</p>

<p>Collecting the Open Steps mirror award or having the ball go in the manhole just below the bumpers redirects the ball into the left out lane from this ramp, with a gate open so the left plunger can be used. Four awards can be available from this left plunge, but only two are initially lit; the other two must be lit before going into the left plunger lane by completing the Step standup targets around the playfield. The four awards, from weakest to strongest left plunge, are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Light Frenzy (on to start the game)</li>
	<li>Light extra ball (requires 2 spellings of Step to light initially, and can only be collected once per game)</li>
	<li>500,000 points (requires 1 spelling of Step to light initially)</li>
	<li>Superdog (always available from a full elft plunge)</li>
</ul>
<p>Collecting a lit award unlights it. Collecting Light Extra Ball also unlights the 500,000 points step. Unlit steps score 100,000 points. There are no special awards for landing on Light Frenzy when Frenzy was already lit, but if a Frenzy was <i>running</i>, Light Frenzy will add 20 seconds to the Frenzy timer. Similarly, collecting Superdog from the Steps left plunger while Superdog was already running adds 20 seconds to that timer as well.</p>

<h3>Quick Multiball</h3>

<p>Started by shooting into the Wind Tunnel scoop when the Mirror is lit and Quick Multiball is the flashing award. Quick Multiball is a 2-ball multiball where everything is in play, with the addition of all shots to Rudy's mouth being worth 1,000,000 points until one of the two balls drains. The clock cannot be advanced past 11:25 until Quick Multiball ends.</p>

<h3>Standard Multiball</h3>

<p>Advance the clock to 11:30, then lock two balls at the Hidden Hallway to advance the clock to Midnight. Then, shoot the third ball into Rudy's mouth to score 1,000,000 points and start 3-ball multiball. During standard multiball, the trap door (upper loop shot slightly later than Rudy's mouth) scores Millions-Plus- 2,000,000 the first time, an additional 1,000,000 each subsequent time, maxing out at 10,000,000. The trap door is open at the start of the multiball, but each time it is collected, it must be reopened with a left ramp shot. The Steps and the Mystery Mirror are not in play during standard multiball.</p>

<p>If single ball play resumes before a Millions-Plus is collected from the trapdoor, a multiball restart is available from the Hidden Hallway for 12 seconds. This starts a 2-ball multiball with the Standard Multiball rules where Millions-Plus can be collected once again.</p>

<h3>Stacking multiball?</h3>

<p>Both Quick Multiball and Standard Multiball can be played at once, but it's difficult to do. First, Quick Multiball must be the only remaining Mirror award. Then, the clock must be advanced to midnight by locking two balls at the Hidden Hallway. Finally, <i>Quick</i> Multiball must be started, not the regular multiball. Following this exact order will start both Quick Multiball and Standard Multiball together, which means both the unlimited million from shooting Rudy and the Millions-Plus from the trapdoor are available.</p>

<h3>Gangway</h3>

<p>Going through the left in lane or making the right orbit (between the bumpers) lights the right orbit for Gangway. Similarly, going through the near right in lane or making the left orbit lights the left orbit for Gangway. The current value of a Gangway is shown by the inserts near the flippers at the bottom of the playfield. Scoring a Gangway also advances the value. The order is 75,000 - 100,000 - 150,000 - 200,000 - 250,000 - 250,000 and light extra ball. Progress on the Gangway is carried over from ball to ball, but only until the Extra Ball at the end of the line is lit; after that, the value resets to 75,000 after each ball. Lighting the extra ball also resets the Gangway value.</p>

<h3>Frenzy and Super Frenzy</h3>

<p>Frenzy is lit from the nearest Crazy Steps award. Super Frenzy is started by making the Wind Tunnel top scoop after previously collecting all 6 Mirror awards. During a Frenzy, every switch in the game adds points to the Frenzy Bonus that is awarded at the end of the ball- 50,000 per switch for Funhouse Frenzy, and 100,000 per switch for Super Frenzy. The Frenzy Bonus starts at 150,000 points in Funhouse Frenzy and 1,500,000 points in Super Frenzy. To reiterate, the Frenzy Bonus is added to the end-of-ball bonus, not awarded directly- so absolutely don't tilt on a ball where either flavor of Frenzy was played!! <br>If both types of Frenzy are running at the same time, the combined Frenzy will always be a Super Frenzy, with a time limit equal to 20 seconds plus the amount of time that was left on the first Frenzy's clock when the second one was started. This applies no matter which order Frenzy and Super Frenzy were started in. <br>The clock cannot be advanced past 11:25 during any Frenzy.</p>

<h3>Superdog</h3>

<p>Superdog is started by a full plunge from the left Steps plunger, or from the mirror award. For 20 seconds, the three standup targets in the center of the playfield all score 200,000 points. Hitting any target increases the value of the targets by 25,000 points. If Superdog is awarded while Superdog was running, 20 seconds are added to the current timer.</p>

<h3>Other Rudy scoring</h3>

<p>The Light Million mirror award makes the next shot to Rudy's mouth score 1,000,000 points. This can be "stacked" with the Million shot for starting multiball, allowing both to be collected at once for 2,000,000 points.<br>Making the skill shot saucer during normal gameplay, typically via a somewhat weak left orbit shot, scores 75,000 points for Rudy's Hideout. <br>Hitting Rudy in the mouth between 6 and 12 times (depending on the game and how long it's been since the last high score reset) scores the Sausage Bonus of 1,000,000 points.<br>If the ball is shot into Rudy's mouth while he is talking, but when his mouth would not otherwise be open, a Rudy Gulp worth 250,000 points is scored.</p>

<h3>Combos</h3>

<p>Left ramp -> right Gangway (orbit) -> Trapdoor loop is a Three way combo worth 500,000 points. Tacking a shot to Rudy's mouth on the end makes it a Four way combo worth an additional 1,000,000 points. If the left ramp is set up to put the ball in the Steps plunger lane, then left ramp -> steps plunge -> trapdoor loop -> trapdoor loop again also counts as a Three way combo, and Rudy can be tacked onto the end to make that a Four way combo as well.</p>

<h3>Bumpers</h3>

<p>Unlit bumpers score 1,000 points and no clock time. Lit bumpers score 2,000 points and 5 minutes of time. Flashing bumpers score 3,000 points and 10 minutes of time. The small angled lane that leads to the right far in lane- makeable from a short plunge or pop bumper luck- advances one bumper, or the Bumpers at Max mirror award will instantly start all 3 bumpers flashing. When the ball drains, the bumpers will be reset to their base value of 1 lit + 2 unlit for the next ball. A ball getting stuck in the flashing pop bumpers is one of the best ways to build the clock toward a multiball.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Funhouse has a conventional in/out lane setup, but with two in lanes on the right side instead of one. The out lanes are lit alternate for a special by making it to 11:30 on the clock twice in a single game. If Crazy Steps has been collected from the Mirror but not used yet, the left out lane is not actually a drain, and serves as just another way to use the Steps plunger.<br>The left in lane lights the right Gangway orbit for its value. The right near in lane lights the left Gangway orbit for its value. The right far in lane lights the Mystery Mirror for about 5 seconds.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Base bonus is just 50,000 points for each time Rudy is hit with a shot over the course of a game. There is no way to multiply this bonus. The only other score that gets added at the end of the ball is whatever is in the Frenzy Bonus pot, if a Frenzy or Super Frenzy was played on that ball. End of ball bonus is pretty negligible if it's just from shooting Rudy, but if you played a Frenzy, don't let the machine even think about tilting away that bonus.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>In competition/tournament play, specials score 1,000,000 points. Extra balls cannot be set to have a point value.</p>

<p>The starting clock position for the first multiball, and for all multiballs after the first together, can be set to anywhere from 3:00 to 10:00.</p>

<p>The Hidden Hallway multiball restart can be set to "long", which still counts down from 12 seconds but doesn't actually count down in real seconds, giving about 20 real seconds for the restart.</p>

<p>The Gangway's starting value at the beginning of a game can be set to any of the first 5 values (75,000 through 250,000 points).</p>

<p>Rudy's Jaw can be set not to light the Mirror at all. If this is the case, the far right in lane is the only way to light the Mirror for an award, and remember it only does so for about 5 seconds. Turning this off is not very fun and would only be done by sadistic operators on very hard settings.</p>

<p>The mirror can be on to start each ball, off to start each ball, or start the game on or off and have memory between balls.</p>

<p>The Frenzy can be lit at the very start of the game. This would only be done for very easy settings.</p>
