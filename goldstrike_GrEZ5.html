<h1>Gold Strike / Lucky Strike (Gottlieb, 1975)</h1>

<p>This same playfield layout was used in all of the following games: El Dorado, Target Alpha, Solar City, Canada Dry, El Dorado City of Gold. Make sure you didn't intend to read about one of those.</p>


<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Hit lit drop targets. If the lights are in front of drop targets that are down, use the star rollover in the center of the table to change which targets are lit. Focus only on lit drop targets.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Lanes</h3>

<p>There are 10 in the game: three in the upper right, two in the middle right, one in the upper left, and the four in+out lanes.</p>

<p>The three upper right lanes score 500 points when not lit, and the lit target value (5,000 points or Wow) when lit. Collecting A, B, and C lights the left, center, and right of these top lanes respectively.</p>

<p>The middle-left A lane lights the two standup targets in the lower left as well as the left out lane all for 1,000 points, in addition to the leftmost top lane. The B lane in the middle right lights the center top lane and the right in lane. The C lane in the middle right lights the rightmost top lane, the left in lane, and the right out lane. Collected A-B-C letters persist for the whole game, so if you're going to prioritize getting these, do so early in the game for best effect.</p>

<h3>Drop targets</h3>

<p>Unlit drop targets score 500 points. Lit drop targets score 5,000 points at the start of each ball. The center star rollover rotates which drop targets are lit. At any time, two drop targets in the upper bank and one in the lower bank are lit. Drop targets are only reset if the center star rollover is hit after all 15 drop targets across both banks have been knocked down. After this happens, lit drop targets and top lanes will score a Wow (extra ball) for the rest of the ball; extra balls cannot be set to be worth points, so in a tournament and/or if extra balls are off, these may not be the most helpful.</p>

<p>On Lucky Strike, the European export version, unlit drop targets score 5,000 points and lit drop targets score 50,000.</p>

<h3>Other features</h3>

<p>Center star rollover: 1,000 points and rotate which targets/lanes are lit.</p>

<p>Bumper: 1,000 points.</p>

<p>Standup targets: 100 points, or 1,000 when lit after the A lane has been collected.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>El Dorado has a conventional in/out lane setup. All in/out lanes score 100 points, or 1,000 when lit. The A lights the left out lane, the B lights the right in lane, and the C lights the left in lane and right out lane.</p>

<p>There is no end of ball bonus.</p>
