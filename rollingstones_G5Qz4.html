<h1 style="color:orange;">Rolling Stones (Bally, 1980)</h1>

<p>Not to be confused with Rolling Stones (Stern Pinball, DMD, 2011).</p>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>The upper left saucer is your friend, because it's a bonus collect and the only way to send the ball up to the top lanes for more Rock letters, which give bonus multiplier. If the ball is on the left flipper, either transfer it to the right, or try to hit 1-5 targets around the bumpers or in the center; each set of 1-5 adds 20,000 to the super bonus.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Rock letters</h3>

<p>All top lanes score 500 points. Going through a lit lane unlights it. There is no lane change to rotate which lanes are lit. Unlighting all 4 letters advances the bonus multiplier in the sequence of 2x-3x-5x; bonus multiplier always carries over between balls. Completing Rock when bonus is already 5x scores a special. Hitting the lit #5 standup target in the center of the playfield also spots one letter in Rock. </p>

<h3>Upper left: Satisfaction target and saucer</h3>

<p>The drop target in front of the upper left saucer is the Satisfaction target, which scores 5,000 points and 3 bonus advance, before then exposing the Collect Bonus saucer. The Collect Bonus saucer gives a full collect of the entire bonus including multiplier before kicking the ball up toward the Rock lanes and re-raising the Satisfaction target. Using the Collect Bonus saucer twice in a single ball awards an extra ball. </p>

<h3>1-5 targets</h3>

<p>The 1 and 2 targets are near the upper left bumper. The 3 and 4 targets are near the upper right. The 5 target is in the dead center of the table. All targets start lit and unlight when you hit them. Hitting any numbered target scores 500 points and a bonus advance whether it is lit or not. The 5 target has a separate light that comes on when you hit one of the posts in the hook lanes in the lower left or right; hitting the 5 target with this light on spots a letter in Rock toward the next bonus multiplier. The first three completions of 1-2-3-4-5 each add 20,000 points to the super bonus that is carried over from ball to ball; any compeltions after that score specials.</p>

<h3>Upper right drop targets</h3>

<p>Each target down scores 500 points. Completing the bank scores the currently lit value on the plastic above the drop targets, which constantly rotates between 5,000, 10,000, 15,000, 20,000, 25,000 and Special. The value you get is based solely on what is lit when you knock down the last target in the bank.</p>

<h3>Side hook lanes</h3>

<p>In the lower left and lower right of the playfield are hook shaped lanes with star rollovers in them. Making a star rollover scores and advances the lit value: 2,000 + 1 bonus advance, then 4,000 + 2 bonus advance, then 6,000 + 3 bonus advance, then 8,000 + 4 bonus advance, then Light Outlane Special, then a repeatable 10,000 + 5 bonus advance. Hitting the post in the middle of the hook lane scores 50 points and lights the center #5 standup target for Spot Rock Letter for a few seconds.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Rolling Stones has a conventional in/out lane setup. Each out lane is lit for a special by scoring 5 hits to that side's hook lane star rollover. Out lanes otherwise score 1,000 points. In lanes always score 500 points and a bonus advance.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Standard bonus is advanced by 1-5 targets, in lanes, and star rollovers in the hook lanes. The standard bonus caps at 19,000 points and resets between balls.<br>The super bonus can be 20,000, 40,000, or 60,000, and is lit/advanced by completing 1-2-3-4-5 once, twice, or three times respectively. The super bonus does carry over from ball to ball.<br>Bonus multipliers are available from completing Rock at the top lanes, and Rock letters can be spotted by the lit #5 target in the center of the playfield. Bonus multipliers are advanced in the order of 2x-3x-5x, and are always carried over from ball to ball.<br>The mid-ball bonus collect at the upper left saucer and the end-of-ball bonus count as the standard bonus plus the super bonus all times the bonus multiplier, for a max possible bonus of 5x 79,000 = 395,000 points.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>In competition/novelty play, specials score 50,000 points and extra balls score 25,000.</p>

<p>Progress on 1-5 numbers, progress on Rock letters, and the lit extra ball at the bonus collect saucer can all be individually set to have memory from ball to ball or reset between balls.</p>

<p>The two hook lanes can be tied together, so that hitting either star rollover advances both sides, sharing their progress.</p>

<p>Bumpers can be set to score 100 or 1,000 points, regardless of 3-ball or 5-ball settings.</p>

<p>The bonus collect saucer can be set not to reset the Satisfaction target when the collect bonus is used.</p>
