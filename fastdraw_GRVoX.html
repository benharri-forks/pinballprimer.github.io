<h1 style="text-align:center">Fast Draw / Quick Draw (Gottlieb, 1975)</h1>

<p>Fast Draw is the 4-player version. Quick Draw is the otherwise-identical 2-player version.</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Hit drop targets one at a time to be sure that each one gives a bonus advance. After clearing both sides, continue to hit drop targets for 5,000 each. Only bother with collecting A-B-C letters if your game is set to 3-ball play instead of 5-ball play, or if it is the final ball of the game; if either of these are true, lighting A-B-C increases your bonus multiplier (from 2x to 3x on final ball, or from 1x to 2x on non-final balls for 3-ball play only).</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>A-B-C lanes</h3>

<p>All A-B-C lanes score 50 points. Roll through a lit lane to unlight it. A can be collected from the leftmost top lane and far left in lane. B can be collected from the center top lane or either near in lane. C can be collected from the right top lane or far right in lane. </p>

<p>A, B, and C light the left, center, and right pop bumpers, respectively. All bumpers score 10 points when not lit. The outer bumpers always score 100 points when lit. The center bumper, when lit, scores 100 points in a 5-ball game, or 1,000 points in a 3-ball game. Lighting A-B-C and clearing one of the two banks of drop targets will light the saucer above the completed bank for a special 1/3 of the time. On 3-ball play only, collecting all three of A-B-C increases the bonus multiplier from 1x to 2x on balls 1 and 2, or from 2x to 3x on ball 3.</p>

<h3>Upper standup targets</h3>

<p>Two pairs: one in the upper left, one in the upper right. One target in each pair is lit at any given time. Lit targets score 500 points and a bonus advance. Unlit targets only score 50 points. The center pop bumper alternates which target in each pair is lit.</p>

<h3>Saucers</h3>

<p>Score 1,000 points, plus an additional 1,000 for each letter in A-B-C that has been collected on that ball, for a maximum of 4,000 points. If A-B-C and one of the drop target banks have both been completed, the saucer on the same side as the completed bank will be lit for special after every 3rd hit of the center pop bumper.</p>

<h3>Drop targets</h3>

<p>Each target down scores 500 points and a bonus advance. Be sure to only hit one target at a time; if you hit another drop target while the 500 from the previous one is still counting, you won't get credit for the points or the bonus advance from the second target. Completing both banks will cause the center target only in both banks to reset; this lone center targets score 5,000 points. If you hit the lone 5,000 target on both sides, the lone 5,000 targets will pop up again. </p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Fast Draw has a conventional in/out lane setup, but with a second in lane on each side in the position of a slingshot. All 4 in lanes score 50 points. The far left in lane lights A, the far right in lane lights C, and both near in lanes light B. Both out lanes always score 500 points and a bonus advance.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is advanced by lit standup targets, the first batch of drop targets (when they are lit for 500 points, but not 5,000), and the out lanes. Max base bonus is 15,000 points. Double bonus is given for free on the final ball of the game; on this ball, completing A-B-C turns the double bonus into triple bonus. <i>Only when the game is set to 3-ball play</i> can double bonus be lit on balls other than the final ball by completing A-B-C. There is no holdover for base bonus or multiplier and there is no mid ball bonus collect.</p>
