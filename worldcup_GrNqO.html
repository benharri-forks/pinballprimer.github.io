<h1 style="color:green;">World Cup (Williams, 1978)</h1>

<p>Not to be confused with World Cup Soccer (Bally Williams, 1994).</p>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>First priority on each ball is to reach 5x bonus by collecting the S-T-A-R letters around the playfield. S and R are collected together, and the top lanes will always give the S or A if both letters on a single lane are lit. After 5x bonus, go for left orbit all day to instantly light the top center lane and side saucers for a goal. If you max out the bonus at 18 goals and a 5x multiplier, the only points left are 4,000 per shot to the left orbit.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>The left and right lanes correspond to S-T-A-R letters: S and T on the left, A and R on the right. Each lane only gives one letter at a time- prioritizing S on the left, and A on the right- but S and R are tied together such that collecting either one gives credit for both. The ST and AR lanes also give 1 ball advance.</p>

<p>The center lane is lit for a Goal at the start of the game and after 4 ball advances. It is also lit for an extra ball after 4 completions of Star on a single ball.</p>

<p>All three top lanes score 100 points.</p>

<h3>S and R bullseye targets</h3>

<p>Score 100 points. Both of them will collect both the S and R letters when hit.</p>

<h3>Corner Kick lane</h3>

<p>A very tight right flipper backhand, or a shot for a lucky bounce off the pop bumpers. The Corner Kick scores 500 points if not lit, or 1,000 points for each light that is lit; the three lamps light after 2, 4, and 6 goals have been scored. This lane also serves as a Super Ball Advance, which instantly lights Goal, and usually spits the ball into the right side saucer.</p>

<h3>Left orbit</h3>

<p>Returns to the top of the playfield. Scores 500 points, or 1,000 for each lit insert. The four inserts light after 1, 3, 5, and 7 goals are made. This lane also serves as a Super Ball Advance, immediately lighting Goal. The most important shot in the game, since it's the best way to get to the top of the playfield for Star letters + it lights Goals for free + 4,000 points is the highest scoring single shot on the table.</p>

<h3>Right super lane</h3>

<p>A small lane kind of in the middle of nowhere. Scores 500 points and a Super Ball Advance (instantly lights Goal).</p>

<h3>Saucers</h3>

<p>Score 500 points, and a Goal when lit. </p>

<h3>Rollover buttons</h3>

<p>Buttons score 100 points. Lit rollover buttons advance the ball up in the direction of the arrows. After 4 advances, Goal is lit at both saucers and the top lane.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Out lanes score 500 points, and are alternately lit for special after completing Star 5 times in one ball. There are no in lanes. The flippers back directly up to the bottom corners of the slingshots. Or at least they would, but this table doesn't have conventional slingshots either, as in their place are full-on kickers that the ball will fall into if the flipper is held up. These kickers usually fling the ball directly at the opposite side saucer, and score 50 points. </p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>The base bonus is the number of goals scored. Goal is lit at the start of the game, relit by making 4 ball advances or going through any Super Ball Advance lane, and collected at either side saucer or the top center lane when lit. Each goal adds 2,000 to the base bonus, and up to 18 goals can be scored. Goal count is carried from ball to ball.</p>

<p>Bonus multiplier is awarded by completing the word Star. The first completion awards 2x bonus and lights the spinner; the second awards 3x bonus; the third awards 5x bonus and lights the top center lane for extra ball. (The fourth lights the out lanes alternately for Special.) Bonus multiplier is not carried over from ball to ball, so always try to complete Star three times as the first order of business. Max bonus is 5x 18x 2,000 = 180,000 points.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>In competition/novelty play, special apparently only awards 1,500 points, according to the game manual. I have yet to test to see if this is true. Extra balls cannot be set to be worth score, they are either on or off.</p>

<p>The S and R can be set to be collected separately, instead of together.</p>

<p>The extra ball and special from Star completions can be set to light after the 4th and 5th completions, respectively, instead of the 3rd and 4th.</p>
