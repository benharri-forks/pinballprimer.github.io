<h1>Star Wars (Data East, 1992)</h1>

<p>Not to be confused with the plenty of other Star Wars pinball games: Star Wars (Sonic, 1987), Star Wars Trilogy (Sega, 1997), Star Wars Episode I (Bally Williams, 1999), Star Wars (Stern Pinball, 2017), Star Wars Home Edition/Comic Art (Stern Pinball, 2019), or Star Wars: The Mandalorian (Stern Pinball, 2021).</p>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>If playing on a game with stock code, shoot the ramp nonstop for the Star Wars letters and the ramp count awards. It's common, though, for games used in tournament play to have a modified ruleset that makes all ramp count awards a mere 1,000,000 (and yes, that is mere); if this is the case, shoot the Death Star repeatedly to light and start multiball and to collect and re-light jackpots, with a brief interlude for the ramp when the jackpot is there.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Skill shot</h3>

<p>The skill shot is a timed plunge based on the DMD animation: press the launch button on the plunger/handle thingy just before an enemy ship enters the crossfire to hit the enemy with a laser and award the skill shot. The skill shot awards 2,000,000 on ball 1 and an additional 1,000,000 on each subsequent ball.</p>

<h3>Star Wars letters</h3>

<p>Any shot to the left orbit (through the pop bumpers), the right orbit, or the center ramp awards a letter in Star Wars at the bottom of the table. Complete the phrase for 10,000,000 points. Progress on the letters is always reset between balls so that only the S in Star is lit, but the plunge will usually give credit for the T as well.</p>

<h3>Center ramp</h3>

<p>The center ramp can be shot from either flipper. At 3, 7, 14, 21, 31, and 43 ramps, a ramp award equal to 1,000,000 points times the number of ramps made in the game so far is scored. (There are likely more than this, but 43 is the farthest one I've seen.) Each center ramp shot also awards a letter in Star Wars. This scoring is very unbalanced! You can make a very good score on this game by shooting nothing but the center ramp all day. Unless...</p>

<p>A common code modification to Data East Star Wars is to make it so that every ramp checkpoint award (the 3, 7, 14, etc) always awards a flat 1,000,000, rather than 3,000,000, then 7,000,000, then 14,000,000, etc. If this is enabled, the ramp goes from being the best shot in the game to arguably the worst, and you should pivot to a Death Star strategy instead. To determine whether you have the good ramp rules or not, shoot the center ramp once and watch the DMD message- if it says "1 ramp 3 for 3 million", then make the ramp your strategy, but if it says "1 ramp 3 for 1 million", start ignoring the center ramp.</p>

<p>If extra balls are on, making 5 and 36 ramps lights an extra ball at the right C-3PO lane, between the Death Star and the right orbit.</p>

<h3>Death Star shot (the big sphere thing)</h3>

<p>Shoot the Death Star target to light one of the 7 moons shown on the playfield. There are two ways to use this to start <s>multiball</s> tri-ball play:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Keep shooting the target until all 7 moons are lit to open the Death Star hole, which gives unlimited time to start multiball.</li>
	<li>To start multiball sooner, listen for the callout "Death Star approaching" after lighting the 5th moon. When you hear this, push down on the shifter plunger and press the fire button to open the Death Star for about 10 seconds; shoot in to start multiball. If this quick start is failed, the Death Star hole will close and all moon progress will be lost.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Death Star target/hole also increases the multiball jackpot, scores the double jackpot, and relights the standard jackpot; all of this is explained in more detail in the Multiball section lower down.</p>

<h3>The Sarlacc Pit and Jabba the Hutt</h3>

<p>The Sarlacc Pit award begins at 500,000 points at the start of each ball. Each bumper hit over the course of the ball adds exactly 23,130 points to the Sarlacc Pit value. If there is a maximum Sarlacc Pit value, it is at least 3,000,000 points. To collect the Sarlacc Pit value, shoot the scoop in the far right of the game.</p>

<p>Shooting the right scoop immediately after going through the left in lane will give the Jabba the Hutt mystery award alongside the Sarlacc Pit. This gives a mystery award such as bonus held, bonus multiplier advance, or 3,000,000 points. The manual claims there are 15 possible awards, let me know if you have a list of everything Jabba can give.</p>

<h3>The Force and the Dark Side</h3>

<p>Shooting the scoop in the lower left of the game awards The Force award when lit, or the Dark Side award when not lit. If the scoop is not lit, it can be lit by shooting the C-3PO lane. </p>

<p>Collecting 4 Force awards uncovers a Super award, and making the Force a 5th time gives that Super award. Force awards can also be spotted by hitting the center ramp 3 consecutive times. Possible regular awards for the Force include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Lite Yoda: lights the C-3PO lane for Yoda's Award, which lets you pick between 2 possibilities: the options Yoda gives you can be Spell Star Wars, 20,000,000 points, Special, Super Death Star, AT-ATs, and possibly others.</li>
	<li>Speeder Mode: despite the word 'mode', this just lights the C-3PO lane for a 10,000,000 point award.</li>
	<li>Super Laser Kick: means the left out lane kickback will stay on for the rest of the ball, instead of turning off once used and needing to be relit.</li>
	<li>Points: self-explanatory, between 3,000,000 and 9,000,000.</li>
	<li>Cantina Mode: a frenzy mode where every switch in the game adds 250,000 points to the Cantina award for 30 seconds. The Cantina starts at 5,000,000 points. The Cantina Award is not added to your score until the end of the ball, so don't tilt on a ball where you played Cantina (it's the only time that end of ball bonus in this game isn't garbage).</li>
	<li>Million Pops: bumpers score 1,000,000 points eah for the rest of the ball.</li>
	<li>X-Wing: for 30 seconds, the five yellow X-Wing standup targets score 1,000,000 each.</li>
	<li>Hold Bonus: self explanatory.</li>
	<li>Max Multipliers: increases the bonus multiplier to the maximum of 8X.</li>
	<li>C-3PO eyes: lights one of C-3PO's eyes, as you'd expect; what that means is explained in the C-3PO Lane section below</li>
	<li>AT-ATs: hit 20 bumpers within about 30 seconds to score 20,000,000 points.</li>
	<li>Light Taun-taun: going through an out lane scores 5,000,000 points. If this is lit and collected multiple times, each Taun-taun scores 5,000,000 more than the previous.</li>
	<li>Light Special: at the right orbit.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Super awards, available by making The Force again after collecting 4 regular awards, include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>25,000,000 points</li>
	<li>Super Death Star: a 50,000,000 point hurry-up that counts down 5,000,000 at a time, collectible at the Death Star target.</li>
	<li>Super R2-D2: another 50,000,000 point hurry-up, but this one counts down 10,000,000 at a time and is collected at the right orbit.</li>
	<li>The Empire: hit the center ramp 3 times within 20 seconds for 30,000,000 points.</li>
	<li>Return of the Jedi: the two orbits and the Force scoop are each lit for one collect of 10,000,000 points.</li>
</ul>

<p>Making the Force scoop when it is not lit scores a Dark Side shot. Every 5th Dark Side shot scores 25,000,000 points. If the feed out of the Force scoop is friendly enough to dead bounce over to the right flipper ofr a trap, it can be a decent strategy to just plug the unlit Force scoop repeatedly to collect 25,000,000s. </p>

<h3>C-3PO lane</h3>

<p>Making this lane lights one of C-3PO's eyes. Light both eyes to qualify a 15,000,000 point hurry-up collectible by shooting R2-D2 at the right orbit. <br>This lane is also lit for Speeder Mode, Yoda's Choice, and Extra Ball by other features in the game.</p>

<h3>Hyperspace drop targets</h3>

<p>These are the 3-bank of drop targets immediately left of the center ramp entrance. Sweeping the bank scores 1,000,000 points. Completing the bank 3 times starts Hyperspace, which advances the bonus multiplier through the sequence 2x-4x-6x-8x and lights the ramp to be worth 5,000,000 points for the next shot. The bonus multiplier can be advanced multiple times during a single Hyperspace by completing the drop targets more times before collecting the 5,000,000 point ramp. Completing this bank of drop targets then making the right orbit at any time relights the kickback in the left out lane if it has been used.</p>

<h3>X-Wing standup targets</h3>

<p>Hit any yellow standup target in the lower table to light it. Light all 5 to light Speeder Mode at the C-3PO lane. A possible Force award is X-Wing Multi Million, which makes these targets worth 1,000,000 points per hit for about 30 seconds. It's pretty much never worth shooting for these targets directly since they're so close to the flippers (and the leftmost one is almost too low to be shot directly anyway, usually being collected out of the bumpers or off the right slingshot).</p>

<h3>Victory Lap</h3>

<p>After making the replay score, shoot either orbit shot within 10 seconds for 25,000,000 points.</p>

<h3>Stormtrooper Shootout</h3>

<p>At random points during the game, you'll start taking fire from Stormtroopers. To score 4,000,000 points from this, press the button on the launcher while both flippers are down within a few seconds.</p>

<h3>Tri-ball (it's really just multiball, I promise)</h3>

<p>See the Death Star section above for how to qualify multiball. Multiball is always 3-balls and started by shooting into the Death Star when the hole is open. The game will plunge two balls for you, and the third will be fed to the right flipper. Hit the Death Star to light the ramp for a jackpot. The jackpot starts at 10,000,000 points, but can be increased 1,000,000 at a time by hitting the Death Star more before collecting the jackpot at the ramp. After the jackpot is made, shoot into the now-open Death Star within about 10 seconds to score a Double Jackpot. After collecting or timing out the Double Jackpot, the process resets, but with 2 hits to the Death Star target now being needed to light the ramp jackpot. The jackpot can be built up for the entire duration of the multiball.</p>

<p>If single ball play is resumed before collecting a jackpot, the Death Star will reopen for about 10 seconds. Shoot it during this time for a multiball restart.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Star Wars has a conventional in/out lane setup. <br>There is a kickback in the left out lane. It is lit at the start of each ball, and unlights once used. It can be relit by completing the center drop targets, then making a right orbit. Both out lanes can be lit for Taun-taun, which gives 5,000,000 points when a ball goes down that out lane (and increases by 5,000,000 points each time if lit and used more than once).<br>The left in lane lights the right scoop for a reflex Jabba the Hutt mystery award. The right in lane lights the left orbit for a reflex 2 Star Wars Letters shot.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus appears to just be contributed to in various amounts by switch hits; I have not found any rhyme or reason to how it grows. Bonus multipliers are tied to Jabba the Hutt awards, The Force awards, or the Hyperspace drop targets: see those sections above for more details. Bonus multiplier is advanced in the pattern of 2x-4x-6x-8x. Bonus tends not to be too valuable on Star Wars, unless you happened to play a long ball that also got a good multiplier going, or unless Cantina Mode was played, since the Cantina Award is part of the bonus (but the bonus multiplier does not apply to the Cantina).</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>As far as I could find in the game manual, there is no setting allowing for extra balls or specials to have a point value. Expect them both to be turned off in competition/novelty play.</p>

<p>The ramp counter can be reset between balls instead of counting up over the course of the game.</p>

<p>At the beginning of each ball, moons toward Death Star multiball will be spotted for you. Settings for this include: always spot 2 moons, always spot 1 moon, spot 1 moon until multiball has been played (default), spot 1 moon until a jackpot has been collected, or never spot moons.</p>

<p>Ball save at the beginning of multiball can be adjusted and set to: only if no Jackpot has been collected, only if multiball time was short (exact length not specified), either of those, both of those, or never have a ball save.</p>
