<h1 style="color:skyblue;">Hang Glider (1976) / Hi-Deal (1975) by Bally</h1>

<p>Hi-Deal is a 1-player version. Hang Glider is a 4 player version. Despite the different names and themes, the two games have identical layouts, rulesets, and scoring, with the lone exception being that the set of 5 targets on the right is drop targets on Hang Glider and standup targets on Hi-Deal.</p>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Shoot the left and right orbits nonstop until the bonus is maxed at 15,000 (from lit top buttons) and doubled (from lit right orbits). Then, complete the targets on the right side of the game to light the spinner. Once the spinner is lit, it's the only thing you should ever shoot for.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top rollover buttons</h3>

<p>There are ten buttons total, but only 1 or 2 will be lit at any given time. Lit buttons score 500 points and advance the bonus, while unlit buttons do nothing. The lit buttons change in the same way every time; they will always be in the same place when the bonus is at a given level. </p>

<h3>Red standup targets</h3>

<p>Score 100 points, or 500 plus a bonus advance when lit. Similar to the top buttons, one or two of these will be lit at a time, with exactly which ones being lit depending on the value of the current end of ball bonus. There are 3 targets in the lower left of the game and 2 in the upper right that all operate under these rules.</p>

<h3>Left orbit and spinner</h3>

<p>Spinner scores 100 points per spin, or 1,000/spin when lit. It is lit by completing the 5-bank of targets in the lower right of the game. Once the spinner is lit, it becomes the only thing worth going for, even if the bonus is not maxed yet (although do try to double the bonus still if you haven't done so already). <br>There is a cutout in the left orbit lane, meaning that shots that don't make it all the way to the top button area may fall into the bumpers instead of back down the spinner lane, and certain ricochets out of the bumpers may put the ball in the spinner lane as well.</p>

<h3>Right orbit</h3>

<p>The switch in this orbit always scores 500 points and advances the bonus. It is also lit intermittently for double bonus. The double bonus light is unclear: it is affected by 10-point switch hits, but it is not a simple alternation, nor does it seem to be tied to specific values of the 10s digit of the player's score or the bonus count. It seems to be lit about 30% of the time. Take advantage of it when it is available- eventually the stars will align so that the double bonus will be lit when the ball is on the left flipper, but it's difficult to force it to happen. The right orbit still has value because of the bonus advance anyway.</p>

<h3>Lower right targets</h3>

<p>Each target scores 1,000 points and lights one of the inserts around the center saucer. Hitting all 5 targets lights the left spinner for 1,000 per spin and lights the in lanes alternately for an extra ball.</p>

<h3>Center saucer</h3>

<p>Scores 1,000 points and a bonus advance for each collected right target. There is no default value for this saucer; shooting it with no targets collected scores 0 points.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Hang Glider/Hi-Deal has a conventional in/out lane setup. Out lanes score 1,000 points. In lanes score 500 points and a bonus advance. Out lanes are lit alternately for extra ball when the base bonus is maxed out at 15,000 points. In lanes are lit alternately for extra ball by completing the 5 lower right drop/standup targets.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Lit top buttons, lit red standup targets, in lanes, and the center saucer all advance the bonus. Right orbit doubles bonus when lit green. Max bonus is 2x 15,000 = 30,000 points. Base bonus and bonus multiplier can never be carried over from ball to ball.</p>
