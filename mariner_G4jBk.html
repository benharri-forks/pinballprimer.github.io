<h1 style="text-align:center">Mariner / Sea Ray (Bally, 1971)</h1>

<p>Mariner is the 4-player version. Sea Ray is the otherwise-identical 2-player version.</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Because so many features' values are pseudo-random based on 10-point switch hits, the most consist route to points in the game is to shoot the center mushroom bumper repeatedly for up to 5,000 points per hit and a raise of the center post. If the center mushroom bumper value is low and the ball is on the left flipper, try to shoot into the Bonus Collect kicker. The left squiggly chute has lots of nice goodies, but is lit randomly and can't be shot directly. The "bonus" is a jackpot, not an end-of-ball bonus, and is lost forever if you drain.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Bonus</h3>

<p>Bonus starts at 1,000 points at the beginning of each player's ball, and is advanced 1,000 at a time by the top rollover buttons, upper right standup target, green mushroom bumpers, and one of the lower standup targets on each side. Bonus maxes out at 10,000 points. This is not an end-of-ball bonus. The only way to score the points in the bonus is to collect it at the top saucer or the kicker lane on the right. The kicker lane has two entrances: one near the bumpers, and one shootable from the left flipper. An ideal plunge bounces back and forth above the top lanes, hitting a rollover button or two, then landing in the saucer for a bonus collect. Collecting the bonus resets it to 1,000 points. There is no multiplier or holdover, nor is there a way to collect the bonus at the end of the ball.</p>

<h3>Bumpers</h3>

<p>Bumpers score 10 points when not lit, or 100 when lit. The left top lane lights the uppermost red bumper, and the right top lane lights the two blue bumpers.</p>

<h3>Intermittent features</h3>

<p>Many features in the game rotate their value based on 10 point switch hits.</p>

<p>The squiggly lane in the upper left can award Up Post, Extra Ball, Open Gate, or On Blue Bumpers. 1, 2, 3, or all 4 awards may be lit at once; the lane will never be completely unlit. Up Post is available most frequently; On Blue Bumpers, second most frequently; Open Gate, third most; and Extra Ball, least frequently.</p>

<p>The lowermost standup targets on the left and right can be lit for Open Gate or Extra Ball respectively. Open Gate is lit more frequently than Extra Ball.</p>

<p>The center yellow mushroom bumper raises the center post between the flippers and scores a random value of either 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, or 5,000. The value changes on 10-point switch hits and jumps around rather than following a discernible pattern.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>There are no in lanes. The flippers are full size 3 inch flippers and back up directly to the slingshots. Out lanes score 100 points. A gate in the right out lane sends the ball back to the shooter lane for a replunge, and closes once used.</p>

<p>The yellow mushroom bumper in the center of the table raises a center post, which completely blocks off the center drain while it is raised. The post is lowered by rollover buttons near the top tips of the slingshots, which also score 10 points when pressed.</p>
