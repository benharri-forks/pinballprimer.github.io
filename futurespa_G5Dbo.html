<h1 style="color:firebrick;">Future Spa (Bally, 1979)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Complete the in line drop targets to max out bonus multiplier, then hit the target at the back of the lane a couple more times to collect the extra ball and special if they are worth points or if they are important to you. After that, shoot either lit spinner, trying to complete the Future letters at the top lanes and hoping that Spa letters are spotted on the way to build the bonus.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Future top lanes</h3>

<p>Each lane scores 500 points. Lit lanes collect the corresponding letter. One of the two center lanes (T, or second U) will be lit with a yellow arrow whose placements alternates with bumper or slingshot hits. Going through the yellow arrow lane turns one of the left out lanes into a single-use second left in lane (see Bottom of the table below). If Future has been completed but Spa has not within the current spelling of Future Spa (which is rare), the first U and the R will alternate being lit with a green arrow for 5,000 points. If the entire phrase Future Spa is completed, the lit green lane will unlight.</p>

<h3>Right side- candy cane shot</h3>

<p>The star rollover at the back of the candy cane/horseshoe lane scores and advances the lit value, and spots one letter in Future Spa. The lit value starts at 2,000 points, increases by 2,000 each hit, and maxes out at 10,000 points. <br>The saucer nestled inside the hook of the candy cane also scores and advances its own lit value, starting at 3,000 and stepping up to 6,000 and then 9,000. The saucer does not spot Future Spa letters. <br>The point value of both the candy cane and the saucer resets between balls.</p>

<h3>Spinners (both sides)</h3>

<p>Score 100 per spin, or 1,000/spin when lit. Both spinners are lit by knocking down the first of the inline drop targets. Spinners all day when lit is a very good scoring strategy for after 6x bonus is obtained.</p>

<h3>Inline drop targets</h3>

<p>Each drop target scores 400 points, and spots a Future Spa letter when lit. The bank is lit for Future Spa letters 1/3 of the time, rotating with the left kickback lane and with both of the two being off, by each pop bumper and slingshot hit. The first drop target lights both spinners; the second lights 2x bonus; the third lights 4x bonus; the fourth maxes the multiplier at 6x and exposes a standup target in the bank. That standup target scores extra ball the first time it is hit, a special the second time, and 20,000 points all subsequent times for the rest of the ball. <br>At the very least, hit the first target to light the spinners and rip the spinners all day. It is recommended to get to 6x bonus from this lane before moving on from it as a strategy, though.</p>

<h3>Center standup target</h3>

<p>If the three letters of Spa have not all been completed in the current set, this target spots one of them and scores 500 points. If Spa is currently finished, this target scores 5,000 points instead.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>There are 4 lanes on the left side. The leftmost lane is a permanent kickback: it scores 3,000 points the first time it is used, increasing by an additional 2,000 on subsequent uses to a maximum value of 9,000 points. The second lane from left is always an out lane. The third lane from left is an out lane by default, but can be turned into an in lane for a single use through the means of a rotating gate by going through the top Future lane that is lit with a yellow arrow. The fourth lane from left is always an in lane. Lanes 2, 3, and 4 all score 500 points, unless the gate is open to make lane 3 an in lane, in which case using up the gate scores 3,000 points. The left slingshot is a conventional size and shape, and scores 10 points.</p>

<p>On the right are two bumpers. The one with the symbol always scores 100 points, like the bumpers in the upper playfield. The other bumper scores 100 points or 1,000 when lit, and is lit whenever Spa is completed, unlighting when a completion of Future Spa resets all letters. Underneath the bumpers is a wireform with a cutout that the ball can fall into. This makes the whole lower right area similar in spirit and strategy to the Beast Lair on Paragon. Do what it takes to prevent the ball from going over here, with up nudges where necessary to pop the ball over the gap. Instead of a conventional slingshot, there is a very small triangle with a passive rubber switch where the slingshot should be that scores 30 points and merely lets the ball bounce rather than being kicked away.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is counted as 2,000 points for each letter in Future Spa collected. Letters are collected from around the table as described above. Completing Future Spa once lights an 18,000 super bonus, allowing the bonus to be built further. The second completion turns that super bonus into a 36,000 super bonus. The third completion, though, scores a special and resets the bonus back to 36,000 points. Max base bonus, then, is 52,000, achieved by completing Future Spa twice and then collect 8 of the 9 letters toward a third completion.<br>Bonus multiplier is collected from the second (2x), third (4x), and fourth (6x) inline drop targets. Max bonus is 6x 52,000 = 312,000 points. Only the 18,000 and 36,000 super bonuses are carried over as part of the base bonus. Bonus multipliers are always reset.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>In competition/novelty play, specials score 50,000 points, and extra balls score 25,000 points.</p>

<p>The yellow and green arrow lights in the Future lanes can be lit together instead of alternately.</p>

<p>The 1,000 bumper in the lower right of the game can be always on, instead of only turning on when Spa is completed.</p>

<p>The Spot Letter lights at the left kickback and inline drop target lanes can be set to always be on, instead of only being on 1/3 of the time.</p>

<p>The special from the inline drop target lane can be set to be repeatedly collectible, rather than the lane value switching to 20,000 points after one special is earned.</p>
