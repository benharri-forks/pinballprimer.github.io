<h1 style="color:purple;">Dolly Parton (Bally, 1979)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>At the beginning of each ball, clear the inline drop targets to light the spinner and 5x bonus. From there, shoot the spinner with the left flipper, and the area to the left of the pop bumpers with the right flipper, both with the intention of making it to the top of the table and finishing more of the Dolly Parton letters.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top saucer</h3>

<p>Spots a letter in Parton and scores 500 points. If Parton has been finished already, the saucer scores 5,000 points instead.</p>

<h3>Dolly standup targets</h3>

<p>Each of the 5 standup targets scores 400 points and collects the corresponding letter in Dolly. If Dolly has been completed, the targets score 1,000 points instead.</p>

<h3>Bumpers</h3>

<p>Always score 100 points. An important skill in this game is to nudge the ball while it's in the bumpers to encourage it to collect the Dolly targets, as there's no other way to collect the Dolly letters.</p>

<h3>Inline drop targets</h3>

<p>The first drop target scores 200 points and lights the spinner. The second scores 400 points and 2x bonus. The third scores 600 points and 3x bonus. The fourth scores 800 points and 5x bonus. Each drop target also spots a letter in Parton. Clearing these 4 drop targets should always be first priority on any ball.</p>

<p>The target at the back of the inline drops lane scores extra ball the first time, special the second time, and 20,000 points each time thereafter. The lane is pretty narrow, so only shoot for these awards if you're very confident in your shooting and if the feed from a missed shot is saveable.</p>

<h3>Right spinner</h3>

<p>Scores 100 points per spin, or 1,000 when lit. Spinner is lit for the remainder of the ball by hitting the first of the inline drop targets.</p>

<h3>Right shooter return lane</h3>

<p>Scores 5,000 points and puts the ball in the shooter lane for a replunge. Not really worth intentionally shooting for.</p>

<h3>Left standup target</h3>

<p>Scores 500 points and doesn't really need to exist.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Each letter in Dolly Parton scores 2,000 points in bonus. Spelling Dolly lights the upper left standups for 1,000 points. Spelling Parton lights the top saucer for 5,000 points. Any completion of Dolly Parton unlights all letters to be collected again. The first completion of Dolly Parton lights the 22,000 super bonus and also lights the in lanes for 5,000 points. The second completion of Dolly Parton lights the 44,000 super bonus and lights both out lanes for a special. Completing Dolly Parton a third time decreases the bonus back from 64,000 to 44,000 and awards a special instead. <br>Bonus multiplier comes from the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th drop targets (2x, 3x, or 5x). Max bonus is 5x 64,000 = 320,000 points, by completing Dolly Parton twice and having 10 of the 11 letters toward a third completion. All letters in progress and super bonuses are carried over between balls, but multipliers are not.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Dolly Parton has a conventional in/out lane setup. Out lanes score 1,000 points, or are lit for a special after two completions of Dolly Parton. The in lanes score 600 points, or are lit for 5,000 after one completion of Dolly Parton.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>In competition/novelty play, extra balls score 25,000 points and specials score 50,000.</p>

<p>The top saucer and in lanes can be lit for 5,000 to begin with, rather than needing to complete Parton once for the saucer and Dolly Parton once for the in lanes.</p>

<p>The out lane special from Dolly Parton completions can be on both out lanes or just the left out lane.</p>

<p>The inline drop targets can be set to not spot Parton letters.</p>

<p>Bonus multipliers can be set to carry over from ball to ball, but the inline drop targets will still reset.</p>
