<h1>Big Game (Stern Electronics, 1980)</h1>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Early in the game, collect drop targets. Hitting a drop target lights that number on whichever bingo card is lit (X, Y, Z, or two of those at once). Lit targets are worth bonus, with additional bonus available from making enough bingo lines and multipliers available by making progress on multiple cards. All base bonus and multipliers carry from ball to ball. Later on, shoot to the spinners in the upper left; if only the inner one is lit, shoot that, otherwise shoot the outer spinner for more points and a collect of all the Big Game letters earned from top lanes, in lanes, and the left standup target.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Big Game letters</h3>

<p>B, I, and G are earned at the top lanes. The second G and A are earned at standup targets on the left side. M and E are earned at the in lanes. Hit the corresponding switch to light it. The Big Game letters can only be completed once per ball; they carry over from ball to ball, unless all 7 are lit, in which case they will reset for the next ball.<br>If B-I-G is complete, the inner spinner will be lit for 1,000 per spin instead of 100, and the star rollover behind it will be lit for 5,000 points instead of 500.<br>If the G and A have been collected, the left standup targets score 5,000 insread of 500. <br>Completing Big Game once lights the left side lane for extra ball, and completing Big Game twice lights the same for a special.<br>The saucer behind the outer spinner scores 5,000 points per lit letter in the current spelling of Big Game, plus an additional 35,000 if Big Game was already completed in full on a previous ball.</p>

<h3>Bingo cards</h3>

<p>There are 3 bingo cards labelled X, Y, and Z. At least one will be lit a any given time. Any top lane, the uppermost pop bumper, the center star rollover, and the slingshots will rotate which bingo cards are lit. If the X is lit, the outer left spinner is lit for 2,000 points per spin. If the Z is lit, the star rollovers in the upper right lane score 2,000 instead of 100.</p>

<p>There are three banks of drop targets around the table, each with numbers on them. The upper left bank is 1-2-3; the upper right bank is 4-5-6; the lower right bank is 7-8-9. Knocking down a drop target scores 500 points and lights the corresponding number on whichever bingo card(s) are lit. At the end of the ball, you receive 1,000 points in base bonus for each lit number on all three cards. If you fully complete all three cards, all lights will turn off and a 27,000 point super bonus is carried to all future balls. <br>Making one three-in-a-row line on each card OR fully completing one card lights 2x bonus. Making two three-in-a-row lines on each card OR fully completing two cards lights 3x bonus. Bonus multipliers always carry over throughout the game.<br>Starting with the 3rd ball of the game, all three-in-a-row lines on all three cards score 5,000 points during the end of ball bonus. This "extra scoring" of 5,000 per line is not affected by bonus multiplier.<br>If all three of the numbers in a target bank are lit on all three cards, any completions of that drop target bank score 25,000 points. <br>If the Z card is fully complete, or if any two different cards feature 4 corners, 2 horizontal lines, 2 vertical lines, or 2 diagonal lines, the right out lane will be lit for extra ball. If both of those conditions are true, the left out lane will be lit for special.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Big Game has one in lane and one out lane on each side, but because of the widebody nature of the table, there is room for two flippers on each side. Both flippers are activated with the same press of a flipper button; stage flipping is not possible. It is NOT possible to scissor drain between the two flippers on the same side, so trap the ball on a lower flipper to your heart's content. In lanes score 5,000 points and award the letters M and E in Big Game. Out lanes score 10,000 points as well as extra ball and special as described above.</p>

<h3>Common rules update</h3>

<p>An alternate ruleset used in many tournaments makes it so that the currently highlighted bingo board out of X, Y, and Z also rotates on its own as time passes. Additionally, in this version of the rules, a secret 5x bonus is available if you complete Big Game letters on a ball where you also got to 3x bonus.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>In competition/novelty play, specials score 100,000 points. A game setting determines if the limit is one special per game or one special per ball. Extra balls cannot have a point value.</p>

<p>The Extra Scoring that gives 5,000 points bonus per completed line can be set to activate on ball 2, 3, 4, or 5.</p>

<p>There are two ways the lit bingo card can be rotated:</p>
<ul>
	<li>On hard settings, only one card is ever lit at once: X, Y, Z, X, Y, Z, etc.</li>
	<li>On easy settings, there are occasionally two cards lit at once: X, Y, Z, X+Y, Z, Y+Z, X, X+Z, repeat.</li>
</ul>
