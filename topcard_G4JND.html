<h1 style="text-align:center">Top Card / Royal Pair (Gottlieb, 1974)</h1>

<p>Top Card is the replay version. Royal Pair is the add-a-ball version. This guide focuses on Top Card, and differences seen in Royal Pair are discussed at the end of the guide.</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Collect playing card targets to light specials and change the star rollover values. Take advantage of 1,000 point star rollovers whenever possible. The deuce and King can be collected at the out lanes in addition to the targets.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Playing card targets</h3>

<p>2-3-4-5-6 targets are in the upper left. 9-10-J-Q-K targets are in the upper right. 7 is in the lower left, 8 is in the lower right, and Ace is in the top center above the bumpers. Hitting any target scores 500 points and rotates the value of a star rollover from 10 -> 100 -> 1,000 -> back to 10, etc. <br>Hitting all of 2-3-4-5-6 qualifies the upper left bumper. Hitting all of 9-10-J-Q-K qualifies the upper right bumper. Hitting both 7 and 8 qualifies the lower bumper. When a bumper is qualified, it will alternate being lit or not with each 10-point switch hit. Lit bumpers score 1,000 points while unlit bumpers score 100.</p>

<p>Hitting all 13 targets in a single game qualifies the specials. Either the Ace target or the two in lanes will be lit for special, alternating on 10-point switches. Also, the star rollover in the center of the bumpers will always be lit for a special.</p>

<h3>Star rollovers</h3>

<p>Score 10, 100, or 1,000 points; values change every time a playing card target is hit (whether it is lit or not) and are displayed in the lower-center of the playfield.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Top Card has a nearly-conventional in/out lane setup, but the in lanes are slanted so that the entrance is closer to the edge of the table. The slingshots are thing rail slings rather than standard triangle slings as a result. In lanes score 1,000 points, or special when lit after all cards have been collected. Out lanes correspond to the 2 (left) and King (right) and so score 500 points.</p>

<h3>Differences in Royal Pair</h3>

<p>In Royal Pair, the add-a-ball game, the playing card targets form two groups. The upper left and lower left targets form the 9-10-J-Q-K-A of Hearts, and the upper right and lower right targets do the same for Diamonds. Completing all of the Hearts or Diamonds targets will light the "Lit Heart/Diamond Target Scores Wow" insert on the playfield. For the rest of the current ball in play, any 10-point switch will rotate which one of the 6 card targets of that suit is lit, and hitting the lit target scores 1 extra ball. If both suits get completed on the same ball, the top center target (the Ace on Top Card) is lit for Super Wow, which is adjustable to 1, 2, or 3 extra balls. When the ball drains, any suit(s) that were completed and had one target lit for Wow will be completely reset for the next ball.</p>

<p>Out lanes score 1,000 points and in lanes score 500 points, with no other benefits.</p>

<p>The rotating star rollover value does not exist. All star rollovers score 1,000 points.</p>

<p>Only one bumper is every lit at a time, and which bumper that is will rotate every time a card target or in lane is scored.</p>
