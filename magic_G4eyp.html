<h1 style="color:yellow;">Magic (Stern Electronics, 1979)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Collect Magic letters to light spinners, then rip the spinners very hard. Whenever the ball is in the pops, try to nudge so that it bounces into the Collect Bonus saucer that's kind of in the middle of nowhere in the upper left. Drop targets increase the bonus multiplier, and eventually score specials. In a pinch, the in lanes advance the bonus and can score up to 8,000 points after 3 activations of the lower star rollover, so shatzing can be possible if the spinners are not viable for any reason.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Magic letters</h3>

<p>The top lanes give M, A, and G. Also, all letters except A can be picked up from standup targets on either side of the middle playfield. Each letter advances the value of the spinners. Both spinners have a starting value of 200 points per spin. The M and G each add 400/spin to the right spinner value, while the I and C each add 400/spin to the left spinner value. The A adds 1,000/spin to the value of one spinner; which one that is alternates with every 10 point switch hit. After completing Magic, one spinner will be lit for 1,000/spin, and the other will be lit for 2,000/spin. </p>

<p>Completing Magic once also lights the star rollover behind the left spinner for an extra ball. Subsequent completions of Magic score a Special directly.</p>

<h3>Bumpers</h3>

<p>The topmost bumper scores 1,000 points and a bonus advance (!) with each hit. The other two bumpers score 1,000 points in 3-ball play and 100 points in 5-ball play.</p>

<h3>Drop targets</h3>

<p>Pretty much impossible to shoot directly other than through a very hard left spinner shot that goes across the top of the playfield. The outer two targets score 1,000 points, and the inner one scores 500 points. All targets down gives the following awards in order:</p>
<ol>
	<li>5,000 points and 2x bonus</li>
	<li>10,000 points and 3x bonus</li>
	<li>20,000 points and 4x bonus</li>
	<li>30,000 points and 5x bonus</li>
	<li>and on: special (can be set to give just one special per ball, or be open ended)</li>
</ol>
<p>The second or third completion of the drop targets also lights a special at the right out lane.</p>

<h3>Collect Bonus saucer</h3>

<p>Positioned in the upper left of the game, it cannot be shot directly from the flippers nor from a shot to the left spinner lane. The only way to end up here is really through pop bumper luck. The collect saucer scores the entire bonus, including the multiplier, and then resets the base bonus back to 1,000, but leaves the multiplier intact. Games of Magic very frequently come down to a player getting one or two more collects than an opponent.</p>

<h3>Star rollovers in center of table</h3>

<p>The upper rollover scores a bonus advance. The lower rollover increases the value of the in lanes by 2,000 points, up to a maximum of 8,000.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Magic has a conventional in/out lane setup, with a center peg between the flippers (that is very needed, since the flipper gap is rather wide). Out lanes score 5,000 points and 3 bonus advances. The right out lane only can be lit for a special after either 2 or 3 completions of the upper right drop targets.<br>The in lanes score 2,000 points and a bonus advance by default: the point value can be increased to 4,000, 6,000, or 8,000 by one, two, or three hits of the lower star rollover directly between the slingshots. Shatzing/alley passing is very possible on this game, and if the spinners are very poor, it can be an okay way to pick up quick points or build the bonus back up after a collect.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>The top lanes, uppermost pop bumper, side standup targets, in lanes, and center star rollover each give 1 bonus advance. The star rollover behind the left spinner and the out lanes give 3 bonus advances. Max bonus is 19,000 points. <b>Bonus multiplier is advanced with each completion of the upper right drop targets. Max bonus is 5x 19,000 = 95,000 points. <br>Bonus can be collected mid-ball at the designated saucer in the upper left of the game. Doing so resets the bonus count back to 1,000, but leaves any multipliers intact. <br>Neither the bonus count nor any multipliers can be carried over from ball to ball.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>Special can score a free game, an extra ball, both of those, or 100,000 points. Extra ball can only be set to on or off, no point value.</p>

<p>The right out lane special can be set to turn on after either 2 or 3 drop target completions. Specials from completing the targets directly starting with the 4th completion can either be limited to one per ball, or unlimited.</p>

<p>The extra ball can be always on, or alternate being lit with every 10 point switch hit.</p>

<p>Bonus, bonus multiplier, in lane value, and all Magic letters (including any completions) are reset from ball to ball. This cannot be changed.</p>
