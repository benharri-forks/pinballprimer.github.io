<h1 style="text-align:center">Tron Legacy (Stern Pinball, 2011)</h1>

<p>The game's full name is Disney TRON Legacy, but it is known to most pinball players simply as Tron Legacy or Tron.</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Shoot lit orange square inserts to qualify Light Cycle Multiball at the near right scoop. Shoot the turnaround lane just right of the left ramp repeatedly to qualify Quorra Multiball at the same scoop. The two multiballs can run simultaneously and can be used to make progress on most other modes in the game. If you are good at shooting the side ramp, you can earn a lot of points from End of Line Jackpots, which grow whenever a combo is made and are collected by shooting the scoop immediately after making a side ramp. End of Line can outclass almost all other scoring in the game if focused on. In the progress ladder on the center of the playfield, flashing modes have been started but not completed, and lit modes have been completed.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Skill shot</h3>

<p>Skill shots come in three flavors.<br>The primary skill shot is a short plunge that enters the Flynn's Arcade near right scoop from behind. This scores a skill shot worth 500,000 points +50,000 each subsequent time, and collects a mystery award if the scoop was lit for one (which it always will be at the start of the game).<br>Skill shot 2 is also a short plunge and serves as a backup plan if your short plunge did not land in the Arcade scoop. The ball will trickle down the unmarked slanted lane and fall toward the in lanes. This starts Flynn mode no matter what, but the actual skill shot is to reflex the ball up the left ramp, for an award worth 250,000 points +50,000 each subsequent time.<br>Skill shot 3 is to hold down the upper flipper when plunging, which lets the plunged ball come around the orbit and down the left side. With the upper flipper, make the side ramp for a skill shot worth 300,000 points +50,000 each subsequent time.</p>

<h3>Mode progress ladder</h3>

<p>The large vertical line of stuff on the playfield shows progress toward modes. All of these will be explained in more detail in the upcoming section, but for now an overview: the four bottom modes, Flynn, Gem, Clu, and Zuse, are timed modes that can run alongside any other mode or multiball. Quorra and the two items above it- which are an identity disc and light cycle respectively- correspond to Quorra Multiball, Disc Multiball, and Light Cycle Multiball. The red-orange claw above Light Cycle is the Recognizer, and is something you'll get for free pretty easily over the course of the game. The word TRON refers to the timed scoring modes that can be given from the Tron targets on the left.<br>If one of these lights is flashing, that means you have played that mode, but not met the requirements to complete it. If a light is solidly on, that mode has been completed. Getting all 9 lights to at least the Flashing status will light Sea of Simulation mini-wizard mode at the Arcade scoop. Getting all 9 lights solidly lit qualifies Portal Multiball wizard mode, also at the scoop.</p>

<h3>"Anytime" character modes: Flynn, Gem, Clu, Zuse</h3>

<p>These four modes require shots to certain features to start. They can run alongside any multiball.</p>

<p><u>Flynn</u> is started anytime the ball trips the unmarked slanted rollover lane directly above the right in lanes. The ball can end up here on the plunge or as one possible exit from the pop bumpers. The goal of Flynn is to shoot the shot with the lit red arrow. The arrow moves across the playfield left to right from shot to shot, before going back the other direction upon reaching the right orbit. Hitting the lit shot will find Flynn and score 275,000 points. The mode ends a couple seconds after you find Flynn, but in those couple seconds, the lit red arrow will move a couple more positions, and you can shoot the red arrow again to find Flynn additional times, with the value increasing by 50,000 points each time. All it takes to make the Flynn mode light flash is to start this round once, and all you need to do to mark the mode as complete is find Flynn once.</p>

<p><u>Gem</u> is started by making enough shots to the upper loop, whose entrance is just above the side ramp. This is intended to be an upper flipper shot, but it is sometimes possible to make this loop as a ricochet off of the Tron targets or the post on the right side of the left ramp. It takes 3 shots to this loop to start Follow Gem first time, and subsequent Gems require two more shots to the upper loop than the previous one.<br>Follow Gem initially lasts for 25 seconds. Activating either of the game's spinners at the turnaround lane or the right orbit will add 10 seconds to this timer, up to a maximum of 40. On the dot matrix display, a few dots in a vertical line will be lit on the border between the player scores and info area, serving as a represenation of this timer- the mode starts with 6 of these dots lit, and 10 lit dots represents the maximum of 40 seconds. <br>You get 250,000 points for starting Follow Gem, and your goal during the mode is to continue to shoot the upper loop. Shots score 750,000 points, +250,000 each time, up to a maximum of 2,500,000. Follow Gem can be running for a long time thanks to the spinner adding time to the clock, so this can be very valuable, especially if coupled with a multiball. Starting Gem once will start flashing the Gem mode light on the playfield: you must shoot the upper loop once during Gem mode to solidly light the insert and mark it as complete.</p>

<p><u>Clu</u> mode is controlled by the three in lanes. All in lanes score 10,000 points. Roll through an unlit lane to light it. Both flippers can be used to rotate lit lanes thanks to lane change. Lighting all three lanes to spell Clu scores 50,000 points and makes progress toward qualifying Terminate Clu mode. The first Terminate Clu requires just one completion of the in lanes, whereas all future runs through the mode require 4 completions. Terminate Clu is started at the Arcade scoop once it is qualified. <br>Terminate Clu is a 25-second mode. The uppermost 10 dots on the vertical border next to player scores on the display serve as a timer. To complete Clu mode, you must make 4 shots within the time limit: the left orbit, the turnaround lane, the right orbit, and the scoop itself. These shots all have a circular insert with a helmet on it in front of them (though the scoop's insert is in front of the right slingshot). These four shots score 250,000, then 325,000, then 400,000, then 475,000. There is no way to give yourself more time, but you can spot the leftmost lit Clu shot by completing the in lanes again during the time limit. Starting Clu once will make the Clu mode light flash, and making (or spotting) all 4 shots in a Clu mode will solidly light the insert to mark it as complete.</p>

<p><u>Zuse</u> is a frenzy mode based on the four post targets around the table. Two are on either side of the left ramp; one is to the left of the right orbit; and one is to the right of the Arcade scoop. Hitting all 4 targets to light them and spell Zuse makes progress toward Zuse's Fast Scoring. The first play of this mode requires just one completion of Zuse, but all future plays require 4 completions. <br>Zuse is a 25-second frenzy mode. The starting value for every switch in the game is 10,000 points (which increases by 5,000 every time you replay the mode). The spinners and bumpers are worth big points while this is going on, but even more important are the Zuse targets themselves. Hitting an unlit target will light it. The first three letters in Zuse that you light each increase the frenzy value by 1,000 points. The fourth lit letter will add 10 seconds to the mode timer and unlight all 4 targets, allowing the frenzy value to be built further. There is no line of dots on the DMD to indicate this mode's timer like there is for Gem or Clu. <br>Starting Zuse's Fast Scoring once will start flashing the Zuse mode light; to make Zuse solidly lit, you must spell Zuse during the mode to add extra time at least once.</p>

<h3>Multiballs: Quorra, Disc, Light Cycle</h3>

<p><u>Quorra Multiball</u> is qualified by shots to the turnaround lane, positioned just to the right of the left ramp. Hitting the spinner just once registers a shot to this lane, but you cannot make another shot that counts for Quorra progress until the spinner completely stops spinning. 5 shots to this turnaround lane lights Quorra Multiball at the Arcade scoop.<br>Quorra Multiball is a 2-ball multiball where the turnaround lane scores regular jackpots, and the upper loop (Gem shot) scores super jackpots. Both are always lit. Jackpots at the turnaround lane start at 250,000 points and increase by 50,000 with each one collected, up to a maximum of 500,000. Super Jackpots at the Gem lane start at 1,000,000 points. Collecting a jackpot adds that jackpot's value to the Super Jackpot. Collecting a Super Jackpot reverts it to the base Super value, plus 250,000 points. Both of these processes can be repeated for as long as the multiball continues. I have not encountered a max value of any kind for the Quorra Super Jackpot.<br>When Quorra Multiball begins, the Recognizer standup targets in the back of the game will raise. Hitting any of the targets in this bank a total of 3 times will add a ball to the playfield. This can be done two times. After two add-a-balls are used, the Recognizer will lower, exposing the Disc, which isn't worth any points.<br>Start Quorra Multiball to flash the Quorra mode light: to mark Quorra as complete, you must collect at least one Super Jackpot.</p>

<p><u>Disc Multiball</u> is tied to the Recognizer 3-bank of standup targets in the back of the game and the spinning disc toy behind them. First, you must hit the Recognizer targets a total of 4 times to lower them. The first hit will flash the Recognizer mode light, and the fourth will turn that light solid- by far the easiest mode light to earn. Once the Recognizer is lowered, it takes 6 shots to the spinning disc if you're playing for your first Disc Multiball, and 2 additional shots for each replay of Disc Multiball. Disc Multiball starts as soon as you make the final Disc shot, which also awards you a free 2,000,000 points. Jackpots are collected at the Disc. The base jackpot value is 250,000 points, increasing by 5,000 points each time. All 6 major shots in the game are also lit for Discs; these shots award mini-jackpots, worth 100,000 points plus 1,000 per switch hit since the last mini-jackpot was collected. When a mini-jackpot is collected, the regular jackpot value at the Disc increases by the amount of that mini-jackpot as well. It takes 6 shots to the Disc to advance to part two of the multiball. In part two, you must reopen the Disc by hitting the Recognizer three more times with a base jackpot value of 280,000 points each. Once the Disc has been opened again, shoot it one time to earn a Super Jackpot equal to the sum of all regular and mini jackpots earned during the multiball. From here, the entire process repeats.<br>Starting Disc Multiball will flash the Disc mode light. You must make it all the way to the Super Jackpot to light the Disc solidly. Disc Multiball starts as a 3-ball multiball. When multiball ends, if you did not collect a Super Jackpot, you can shoot the Disc within 10 seconds to restart Disc Multiball with two balls.</p>

<p><u>Light Cycle Multiball</u> is the most straightforward to qualify just looking at the playfield inserts, but has more complex rules than the other two multiballs. The six major shots in the game- left orbit, left ramp, turnaround, Gem lane, side ramp, right orbit- are all lit for Light Cycle, which is the large orange square insert. Make a shot with this insert lit to unlight it. For the first Light Cycle Multiball, making any four of these six shots is sufficient to qualify multiball at the Arcade scoop; to replay Light Cycle Multiball, you need all 6 shots to qualify.<br>Light Cycle is a 2-ball multiball. Three of the six major shots in the game will be lit for Light Cycle, which means they score jackpots that are always worth 350,000 points. If you collect a jackpot at the left ramp, you can earn Super Jackpots by forming a combo. Left ramp -> turnaround shot scores a Super Jackpot worth 750,000 points. Left ramp -> turnaround shot -> side ramp scores a Double Super Jackpot worth 1,500,000 points. These combos only award super jackpots if the left ramp was lit for a jackpot initially; if it's not, you need to collect other jackpots until the left ramp is lit. <br>Starting Light Cycle Multiball will flash the Light Cycle mode light. To complete the mode and solidly light the Cycle, you must collect two super jackpots or one double super jackpot.</p>

<p>Light Cycle Multiball and Quorra Multiball can run at the same time. Disc Multiball cannot run alongside either of them. If Light Cycle or Quorra is already running and the other is started, the stacked multiball will have 3 balls instead of the usual 2. Since there are only 4 pinball installed in the game, you cannot use the second add-a-ball in Quorra Multiball until one of the four balls drains.</p>

<h3>Tron Scoring</h3>

<p>There are three scoring opportunities made available by the Tron targets on the left side of the playfield: Double Scoring, Super Pops, and Super Spinners. These are all 25-second scoring opportunities, and the time limits for each are shown by the horizontal lines of dots directly below the player scores on the display. One of the three modes will flash on the playfield; when you complete the Tron targets, the flashing mode will begin and be lit. <i>Version difference: the Tron targets are drop targets on the Limited Edition of Tron, but they are standup targets on other versions.</i> Pop bumpers rotate what the next Tron mode to start will be, but it will never select one that's already running. If all three are running, completing Tron again will just add time to the flashing mode, which can be any of the three. Tron Scoring modes can be started at any time, including during Character modes, Multiballs, and Wizard modes.</p>

<p>Double Scoring is a 2x playfield multiplier for its entire duration. This applies to all scoring in the game, including all multiball jackpots. The only exception that I know of are the bonuses you receive for solidly lit mode lights during Sea of Simulation (even that might be wrong, but I think I have seen the double not work there once before). If you drain the ball during Double Scoring, your entire bonus is doubled, which compounds on top of the regular bonus multiplier.<br>Super Pops and Super Spinner multiply the value of the bumpers and spinners respectively by 3 for their duration. If Double Scoring is running alongside Super Pops or Super Spinners, the bumpers or spinners in question will score 6x instead of 3x.</p>

<p>The unmarked lane above the in lanes that starts Find Flynn also activates a feature called Zen. If Zen activates and then you immediately shoot at any unlit Tron target, the currently flashing Tron Scoring mode will being for free without needing to complete the entire bank.</p>

<h3>Sea of Simulation: mini-wizard mode</h3>

<p>If all 9 mode lights are either flashing or lit, but they are not all solidly lit, the Arcade scoop will be ready for Sea of Simulation unless a multiball is running. The game will progress through the mode lights from bottom to top. If a given mode light is solidly lit, you receive an award and the game moves to the next mode. If that insert is only flashing, you must play a short mode to light that insert before proceeding to the next step up the ladder. The sequence goes like this:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Flynn: 1,000,000 points if completed. If not, you must shoot the scoop once for 100,000 points.</li>
	<li>Gem: 2,000,000 points if completed. If not, you must shoot the Gem shot once for 200,000 points.</li>
	<li>Clu: 3,000,000 points if completed. If not, you must shoot the four Clu shots for 300,000 points each.</li>
	<li>Zuse: 4,000,000 points if completed. If not, you must shoot the four Zuse post targets once each for 400,000 points a pop.</li>
	<li>Quorra: 5,000,000 points if completed. If not, you must shoot the turnaround lane once for 500,000 points.</li>
	<li>Disc: 6,000,000 points if completed. If not, the 6 major shots light for Discs, and you must collect all six for 600,000 points each. The Disc itself is exposed during this, and will spot a shot for you.</li>
	<li>Light Cycle: 7,000,000 points if completed. If not, you must shoot the 6 major shots in the game for 700,000 points each, but only three of the six are lit at first, and more will light as you make other shots.</li>
	<li>Recognizer: 8,000,000 points. It's impossible to have the Disc flashing without completing this one, so there's no backup mode.</li>
	<li>Tron: 9,000,000 points if completed. If not, you must hit each Tron target once for 900,000 points each.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sea of Simulation can only be played once before reaching Portal Multiball wizard mode. If you make it through the entire Sea of Simulation progression, the Arcade scoop will immediately be lit for Portal Multiball wizard mode. If you drain out of Sea of Simulation, all flashing mode lights at or above the level you drained at will unlight, and you must fully light them the hard way before Portal Multiball is lit.<br>During Sea of Simulation, shooting the right orbit at any time will light the Arcade scoop's mystery award. This mystery award will always spot one shot for you at 1/10 the value if Sea of Simulation is running. This can be a much easier way to collect the side ramp or Gem lane shots that Gem, Disc, and Light Cycle require.</p>

<h3>Portal Multiball: wizard mode</h3>

<p>If you light all 9 mode inserts solidly before playing Sea of Simulation, you will be able to play Portal Multiball while skipping Sea of Simulation entirely. In this case only, the start of Portal Multiball will pay you off a total of 45,000,000 points, just like the Sea of Simulation progression.</p>

<p>Portal Multiball is a 4-ball multiball that is started at the scoop if all 9 mode lights are solidly on and no other multiball is running. All major shots will have just one insert flashing to begin. Any shot with a flashing insert scores a jackpot. Jackpots start at 500,000 points and increase by 50,000 with each one collected. When you collect a jackpot, the flashing insert at that shot will become lit, and the next insert will flash if there is one. The goal is to light every insert on all 6 major shots. This requires 4 shots to the left orbit, 3 shots to the left ramp, 5 shots to the Quorra turnaround, 3 shots to the Gem lane, 3 shots to the side ramp, and 4 shots to the right orbit. This is a total of 22 shots; the last two jackpots will both be 1,500,000. When you light every insert at a shot, one ball will be added to the playfield, unless all 4 of the game's pinballs are in play. The Tron targets can still start Double Scoring in this mode; this will double the current jackpot, and add the value of that doubled jackpot into the Super Jackpot. After making all 22 shots, the Disc will be opened for a single Super Jackpot, whose value is equal to 1,000,000 points plus the sum of all 22 jackpots you earned to get to that point. This is at least 23,500,000 points, and can still be doubled by Double Scoring. After the Super Jackpot is collected, all major shots in the game plus the Disc score a flat 1,000,000 points for the rest of multiball. Portal instantly ends if single ball play resumes, even if you did not collect all 22 jackpots.</p>

<p>As soon as Portal Multiball ends, no matter how far you got, the game will clear all 9 mode inserts, and you basically restart the entire game's progression from the beginning, except hopefully you have a lot more points now than you did at the start of the game.</p>

<h3>Additional ramp features</h3>

<p>This is a major version difference between the Limited Edition version of Tron and the other versions of the game.</p>

<p>On the standard versions, the game keeps track of the number of shots made to either ramp (left or side) throughout the game. At 12 and 100 total ramps, the Arcade scoop will be lit for extra ball.</p>

<p>On the Limited Edition, this is much more nuanced and has more features. The left ramp will spot letters in the word Daft if it is not lit for anything else and no multiball is running. The side ramp will do the same for the letters in the word Punk. Spelling Daft Punk once lights the scoop for an extra ball. Spelling Daft Punk a second time lights the scoop for the exclusive End of Line Multiball (frequently called Daft Punk Multiball by fans). End of Line Multiball is a 2-ball frenzy multiball where every switch in the game scores 10,000 points. Any shot to the Recognizer targets scores 200,000 points and adds 1,000 points to the frenzy value. The first add-a-ball is available after 2 shots to the Recognizer; the next add-a-ball requires 3 more shots; the third requires 4 further shots; etc. Add-a-balls are not available if all 4 of the game's pinballs are already on the playfield. <br>I am not sure if End of Line Multiball can be stacked with Quorra or Light Cycle Multiball, but it definitely cannot be stacked with Disc Multiball.<br>I have no idea what awards are available for more than two completions of Daft Punk.</p>

<h3>Combos and End of Line Jackpots</h3>

<p>The End of Line Jackpot starts each ball at 500,000 points. When you make a combo of any type, the shot you used to make the combo determines how many points are added to the End of Line Jackpot. The left orbit seems to add 350,000 to the jackpot; the turnaround seems to add 400,000; the side ramp seems to add 500,000. I'm not sure exactly how many points the left ramp or Gem lane add, or if the amount that does get added depends on other factors such as the length of the combo. The current End of Line jackpot can be collected by shooting the Arcade scoop immediately after making the side ramp. The End of Line jackpot can be cashed in at any time, including during multiballs, but it can only be increased during single ball play. Collecting the End of Line jackpot does not reset it; the only thing that does reset the jackpot is the end of the ball. A very helpful combo to learn on Tron is left ramp -> Quorra turnaround -> side ramp -> Arcade saucer. It's immensely difficult to do and even harder to master, but it's the easiest way to tens of millions of points if you can do it reliably.</p>

<h3>Mystery award</h3>

<p>The Arcade scoop is lit for a mystery award at the beginning of the game or after making any right orbit shot. In regular play, the mystery can be any of these:</p>
<ul>
	<li>500,000 points</li>
	<li>Advance or Complete Recognizer (will only be Complete if the Recognizer only needs 1 more hit)</li>
	<li>Advance or Start Quorra Multiball (same note as above)</li>
	<li>Advance or Start Gem (same note as above)</li>
	<li>Advance Clu: awards one full completion of Clu</li>
	<li>Light extra ball: at the Arcade scoop</li>
	<li>Light special: on the out lanes</li>
</ul>
<p>During Sea of Simulation, the mystery award always spots one shot in whichever mode you are in. To my knowledge, the mystery award cannot be used to spot shots during Portal Multiball.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Tron Legacy has a conventional in/out lane setup, but with two in lanes on the right instead of one. The in lanes can be lit to spell Clu to qualify Terminate Clu mode. The out lanes can only be lit for special by the mystery award. There is no kickback or center peg.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is calculated as 50,000 points, plus 50,000 for each flashing light on the mode ladder, plus 250,000 for each solidly lit mode light, plus 450,000 for each Sea of Simulation played, plus 2,250,000 for each Portal Multiball played, all multiplied by the bonus multiplier. Bonus multiplier is increased by 1x with each shot to the Gem lane. If there is a max bonus multiplier, it is at least 8x. The entire bonus can be doubled on top of the bonus multiplier if Double Scoring from the Tron targets is running when the ball drains. Bonus is a very worthwhile part of scoring once you've collected at least 2 or 3 completed modes. Bonus multiplier can never be carried from ball to ball. There is no mid-ball bonus collect.</p>

<h3>Final note</h3>

<p>If specials and extra balls can be set to have a point value for tournament play, I do not know what that point value is. I would expect extra balls to be worth between 2,000,000 and 5,000,000 points.</p>
