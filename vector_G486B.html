<h1 style="color:orange;">Vector (Bally, 1982)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Completing targets in order is always preferred to simply completing the bank at random. If the back left drop targets are completed in order, the ramp is lit for lock without needing to clear the front left drop targets. Completing H-Y-P-E in order multiplies the display bonus, maxes the ramp value, and immediately starts multiball if anything has been locked. During multiball, try to hit the ramp with repeated hard shots. The display bonus can be very big so don't tilt, especially if it carries from ball to ball.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Upper playfield and X-Y-Z targets</h3>

<p>The ball will end up here on the plunge, by shooting the left Vectorscan ramp when it is not lit for lock, or by shooting up the wide center ramp or far right ramp. <br>The bumper, which is obscured by playfield plastic with explosion art, scores 5,000 points and advances the display bonus by 3,000. <br>Completing the X-Y-Z targets advances a multiplier for the V bonus at the bottom of the playfield, not the display bonus. Awards for this bank follow the order 2X - 3X - 5X - 25,000 - special, alternating between the last two for future completions. <br>When the X-Y-Z targets are flashing, they are still in sequence. Making X-Y-Z in sequence scores an additional 10,000 points on top of the standard completion award, and also spots one of the Defender targets in front of the left ramp.</p>

<h3>Defender drop targets and left Vectorscan ramp</h3>

<p>At the start of the ball, the back row of left drop targets will be standing. Each target down adds 3,000 to the display bonus. If the targets are completed in sequence from left to right, the ramp is immediately lit for a lock. If they are completed out of sequence, the front left drop targets will raise, and <i>those</i> must be completed to light the ramp for a lock. The front left drop targets add 9,000 to the display bonus each. If the back left drop targets are still considered to be in sequence, the arrows in front of them will flash.</p>

<p>Whenever the ball triggers the hanging switch at the bottom of the ramp, the left side of the playfield display will start at 999 and count down very quickly. The countdown stops when the ball triggers a switch at the end of the ramp, in the very back right of the table. The number displayed when the countdown is stopped is the "flip speed". The current fastest flip speed record will be shown on the right side of the playfield display in red while this happens. If the current flip speed is faster than the displayed record, a special is immediately earned. If the current flip speed is greater than 800, an extra ball is immediately earned and the out lanes are lit alternately for Speed Special. No matter what, if the ball makes it up the ramp successfully, the ramp scores 100 points times the flip speed, rounded down to the nearest 1,000. <br>In addition to the flip speed score, a successful ramp shot scores 3,000 points for each lit arrow on the ramp's path. Each completion of the H-Y-P-E targets lights one of these arrows, or completing H-Y-P-E in order instantly lights all of them.</p>

<p>If the ramp is not lit for lock (usually when one of the Defender targets is still up), the saucer that the ball ends up in at the end of the ramp will kick the ball up toward the upper playfield. If the ramp is lit for lock, the saucer will kick the ball down into the next available saucer. If three balls are locked, multiball begins, regardless of who locked the other ones. Multiball is really just for having more balls in play to hit things, including and especially more left ramp shots. Any shot to the ramp during multiball gets kicked up to the upper playfield.</p>

<h3>H-Y-P-E targets</h3>

<p>Each H-Y-P-E target adds 3,000 to the display bonus and 1,000 to the V bonus. Completing H-Y-P-E in order advances the bonus multiplier on the display bonus, maxes out the arrows on the ramp shot, scores 10,000 points, and releases all locked balls for an instant multiball start. Making H-Y-P-E out of order does nothing except light one of the ramp arrows. </p>

<p>On the last ball of the game only, making H-Y-P-E out of order will release exactly one locked ball for an instant two-ball multiball. This can only be used once per player per game.</p>

<h3>Star rollover</h3>

<p>At the top of the far right ramp, and kind of in no-man's-land relative to the rest of the upper playfield, as a star rollover target. Hitting this star button advances the V bonus by 1,000 and scores the current star value, which starts at 5,000, increases by 5,000 each time it's hit, and maxes out at 25,000. It's mildly helpful if this star gets hit a few times, but not really worth shooting for directly.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>The left side of the table has a reversed in and out lane. The in lane, which is closer to the edge of the table, advances the display bonus by 3,000 and the V bonus by 1,000. There is a V symbol in the in lane: collect both (the other is in the right in lane) to automatically lower one of the left Defender drop targets. The left out lane advances the display bonus by 3,000 and can be lit for Speed Special. <br>There is a saucer in the far lower left of this area. Nudging the ball into this saucer will score the current V bonus (without the multiplier) and fire the ball back into play through a one way gate and directly at the flippers. </p>

<p>The right side of the table is mostly the same, but the in and out lanes are not reversed. The right in lane also adds 3,000 to the display bonus and 1,000 to the V bonus, and has the second V symbol toward spotting a drop target. The out lane also advances 3,000 display bonus and can be lit for speed special. There is a saucer in the out lane as well, which also scores the unmultiplied V bonus: this saucer sends the ball into the in lane through a one way gate that actually makes up part of the in/out lane separator rail.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>There are three different bonuses collected at the end of the ball: the display bonus, the V bonus, and the ramp bonus.</p>

<p>The display bonus starts at 1,000 points, and is so named because it is displayed in the playfield. It is advanced by 3,000 points for each X-Y-Z target, back left drop target, H-Y-P-E target, in lane, and out lane. It is also advanced by 9,000 points for each front left drop target. I am not aware of a maximum value of the display bonus, and can only assume it is 999,000 points. Completing H-Y-P-E in order advances the multiplier for the display bonus up to 2X or 3X. The multiplier is not carried from ball to ball. The display bonus itself does carry between balls by default, but this can be disabled.</p>

<p>The V bonus also starts at 1,000 points and is incremented by H-Y-P-E targets, the star rollover, and the in lanes. Completing the X-Y-Z targets advances the V bonus multiplier up to 2X, 3X, or 5X. Either of the saucers in the out lanes at the bottom of the playfield score the current V bonus without the multiplier. The full bonus with the multiplier is only scored when the ball drains. The V bonus resets between balls unless it is advanced to 20, which is a super bonus that is held for the rest of the game. Advancing the V bonus to its max value of 39,000 scores a special. Max V bonus is 5x 39,000 = 195,000 points.</p>

<p>The ramp bonus is 3,000 points for each lit arrow in the ramp lane. One arrow lights each time H-Y-P-E is completed out of order; all arrows are immediately lit if H-Y-P-E is completed in order once.  There are 8 such arrows, so this bonus maxes out at 24,000 points. It cannot be multiplied or carried from ball to ball.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>The Defender drop targets can be set so that the front set always pops up after the back set is completed, even if the back set was completed in order.
<br>The X-Y-Z targets can be set to alternate their awards, so that 2X - 3X - 5X - 25,000 - Special occur on the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th completions, rather than the first five. They can also be set to have the award alternate between 25,000 and Special after enough completions, or set the award to always be 25,000 once a special is collected.
<br>The Fastest Flip can be set to reduce over time (every 8 games) to make getting the Fastest Flip special slightly easier.
<br>The display bonus can be set to carry over or reset between balls.
<br>The flip speed can be set to only score if the ramp was lit for lock.
<br>The minimum flip speed to score the extra ball and light one out lane special can be set to 700 or 750. Any flip speed over 800 regardless of this setting lights both out lane speed specials.
<br>H-Y-P-E targets can be set to only advance the V bonus when lit, instead of every time.
<br>Special and extra ball are worth 50,000 and 25,000 respectively when set to points in competition/novelty play.</p>
