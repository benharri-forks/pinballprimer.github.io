<h1 style="color:yellow;">Earthshaker (Bally Williams, 1989)</h1>

<p>The rules of this game are very similar to Whirlwind (Bally Williams, 1990). If you know that game well, you'll pick this one up easily.</p>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Early in the game, focus on collecting miles from the center and side ramps to build up base bonus. Light all of the numbers shown on the building in the back of the game to light locks towards multiball and advance the bonus multiplier. During multiball, the center ramp qualifies the jackpot and the side ramp collects it, but there's only one jackpot available, so only collect it if the backbox of the game shows a good reward, and clear the drop targets first to change the reward if not.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Skill shot</h3>

<p>The skill shot is a precise power plunge that can fall off the loop in the back of the game at one of four points. Those four drop-offs score 10,000, 25,000, 50,000, or 100,000 points, and drop the ball into the pop bumper area. A full power plunge that makes it all the way around the loop, avoiding the drop-offs, scores 25,000 points and adds 1 mile and drops the ball in the left in lane (which immediately lights the center ramp for 2 miles).</p>

<h3>Zones and locks</h3>

<p>There are 9 "zones" throughout the game, numbered as follows:</p>
<ol>
	<li>the lower left standup target</li>
	<li>the lower right standup target closer to the side ramp</li>
	<li>the lower right standup target closer to the right in lanes</li>
	<li>the standup target just to the right of the center ramp</li>
	<li>the eject hole just left of the center of the table</li>
	<li>the upper loop, makeable from the upper left flipper as an earlier shot than the side ramp</li>
	<li>the right in lane closest to the flippers</li>
	<li>the left in lane</li>
	<li>the captive ball</li>
</ol>
<p>The zones needed to light the next lock for standard multiball will be shown on the Earthquake Institute building in the back of the game; the flashing numbers are the ones required. Some or all of the flashing numbers will flash on the playfield as well; those are the ones eligible to be collected. For the first multiball, all of the zones required for the lock are made available at once. For the second multiball, the flashing numbers required will need to be completed one row at a time from bottom to top as they are shown on the building. For the third multiball and on, only one zone will be flashing at a time, and they must be made in order. Also, at the begining of the game, only 4 zones are needed to light a lock, but this increases with each subsequent multiball- I've seen it go as high as 6, but wouldn't be surprised if it can require even more. <br>The lowest numbered zone that has not yet been collected can be spotted by either making the side ramp or shooting the captive ball in the lower right of the game. <br>Once all of the zones indicated on the building have been collected, a lock is lit and the bonus multiplier advances. If the lit lock is the first lock for the current multiball, either the side ramp or the Shelter scoop in the back right will award the lock; if the lit lock is the second lock, though, it can only be made at the side ramp.<br>The bonus multiplier progression is 2x - 3x - 4x - 5x - 6x and lite extra ball - 6x and lite special.</p>

<h3>Center ramp and miles</h3>

<p>The first trip up the center ramp on a ball scores 25,000 points; the second scores 50,000 points; subsequent trips score 10,000 more than the previous, up to a maximum of 100,000 points per ramp. The center ramp also awards miles- 1 mile when not lit, or 2 miles when lit by a ball going through the left in lane (and the ramp itself puts the ball back into the left in lane, so it effectively lights itself). Since the center ramp is best shot from the left flipper, it can be looped repeatedly as a one-flipper shot, and if you're very good at this, center ramp all day can be a very good strategy for points. <br>Even though the playfield inserts don't show values above 75 miles, the max you can collect is actually 99 miles. Once the miles are maxed out, any further center ramp shots for the rest of the game score the End of the Road award of 200,000 points, making it even more lucrative as a strategy. <br>At the end of each ball, the number of miles collected is multiplied by the bonus X, then multiplied by 1,000 points to form part of the bonus score. This always uses the number of miles made in the entire game so far, so center ramp all day has even more importance as a strategy during ball 1 of a game, especially if extra balls are on. <br>Extra balls are lit at the upper right shelter scoop upon reaching 12 and 60 miles. The out lanes are lit alternately for a special after reaching 75 miles.<br>Finally, the center ramp temporarily increases the value of the captive ball in the lower right of the game.</p>

<p>During standard multiball, the center ramp must be made to light the jackpot at the side ramp.</p>

<h3>Upper loop and bumper value</h3>

<p>The upper loop can be made in either direction. To shoot it clockwise, aim with the lower right flipper at the large yellow arrow between the upper left flipper and the zone 1 target. To shoot it anticlockwise, make a shot with the upper flipper just barely earlier than the side ramp shot. A spinner in the back of the upper loop scores 1,000 points per spin, or 3,000/spin if it has been lit by a ball going through the outermost right in lane. Making the loop in either direction advances the bumper value. Making the loop anticlockwise only (i.e. form the upper flipper) is the zone 6 shot.</p>

<p>At the beginning of each ball, two bumpers will be unlit, and one (typically red) will be lit. Each successful upper loop advances the bumpers- first by turning one of the lit ones on, then by making lit bumpers flash one at a time. Bumpers score 1,010 points when not lit, 2,010 points when lit, 3,010 when flashing, or 5,010 when all three are flashing. Making additional loop shots after all three bumpers are flashing scores a 100,000 point loop bonus. Bumpers can also be instantly maxed out (all three flashing) from the Jet Bumpers On shelter award. </p>

<h3>Drop targets (the "billboard")</h3>

<p>Completing the bank for the first time on a ball scores 50,000 points; further completions score 10,000 more than the last, up to a maximum of 100,000 points. The value can be instantly maxed out by the "Billboard 100k" shelter award. Any completion of the drop targets also advances the jackpot value in the following order: 500,000 + a special -> 1,000,000 -> 1,250,000 -> 1,500,000 -> 1,500,000 + an extra ball -> 2,000,000 -> 2,500,000. Advancing again when the value is at 2,500,000 resets it back to 500,000 + a special. </p>

<h3>Shelter scoop (back right)</h3>

<p>The Shelter scoop awards a Match-up, which is effectively a mystery award with a fancy gimmick (which can last a varying amount of time, so watch the kickout carefully so you're not caught off guard!). The two lines of the score display will shuffle through awards, and when both match, that's the award you get. The possible awards are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>2 or 5 miles</li>
	<li>100,000 points</li>
	<li>Spot a zone</li>
	<li>Complete the building (instantly lights lock and advances bonus X)</li>
	<li>Light Quick Multiball</li>
	<li>Light Special (very rare)</li>
	<li>Billboard 100K</li>
	<li>Jet Bumpers On</li>
	<li>Instant Extra Ball (only seen at the end of games with very short ball times)</li>
</ul>

<p>The first ball toward 3-ball multiball can be locked at the shelter.<br>The saucer advances the minimum value of the captive ball (explained below).<br>When extra ball is lit (from 12 or 60 miles, or from lighting 5 locks over the course of the game), it is collected at this saucer.</p>

<h3>Captive ball</h3>

<p>The minimum value of the captive ball is 25,000 points. Shots to the center ramp increase its value to 50,000, then 100,000, then 150,000, then 250,000 points. If the captive ball value is not at the minimum, the value will decrease one step every 8 seconds or so. Hitting the captive ball scores the lit award and spots the lowest numbered zone that is still required. Hitting a 250,000-point captive ball also lights Quick Multiball. <br>The minimum value of the captive ball can be increased one stage at a time with shots to the Shelter scoop. The captive ball value does not decrease beyond the minimum on its own, but the minimum value will reset back to 25,000 points if a non-minimum value is collected. The purpose of increasing the minimum value is just to require fewer combo ramp shots to light the captive ball for 250,000 points and a Quick Multiball.</p>

<h3>Quick Multiball</h3>

<p>Quick Multiball is lit from a Match-up award at the shelter scoop, or by collecting a 250,000 point captive ball award. Once lit, Quick Multiball is started by shooting the zone 5 scoop. Quick Multiball is a 2-ball mode where the side ramp scores 1,000,000 points one time. If there is not currently a ball locked for standard multiball, zones can still be collected toward lighting lock 1. If one lock has already been made, Quick Multiball instantly lights the second lock at the side ramp. Locking both balls toward regular multiball during Quick Multiball instantly turns the Quick Multiball into a standard 3-ball multiball. Making the Million shot three separate times in a single game instantly awards an extra ball.</p>

<h3>Standard multiball</h3>

<p>A 3-ball mode started by completing a Zone map then locking a ball, two separate times. During standard multiball, the goal is to shoot the center ramp to light the side ramp for a jackpot, then shoot tha side ramp to collect the jackpot. Only one jackpot is available during the multiball, so be sure that it's on a value you want before collecting it, or focus on drop target bank completions first instead. In a game where extra balls are on, the most lucrative award is probably 1,500,000 and an extra ball; otherwise, go for the 2,500,000. After the jackpot has been collected, the only thing left to do in multiball is shoot the side ramp for 250,000 points each. Zones toward the next multiball cannot be started until the current multiball ends. There is no playfield scoring multiplier during multiball.</p>

<p>If the Jackpot is not collected during multiball, the shelter scoop will be lit for about 15 seconds for Aftershock Multiball. Aftershock is a 2-ball multiball restart that follows the same rules as regular multiball. Even if Jackpot was lit when standard multiball returned to single-ball play, it must be re-qualified with a center ramp shot during the Aftershock to be collected.

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Earthshaker has a mostly conventional in/out lane setup, with two in lanes on the right instead of one, and a center peg between the flippers. The out lanes score 50,000 points, and are lit alternately for a special by the very rare Light Special shelter award or by reaching 75 miles. The left in lane scores 5,000 points, gives credit for zone 8 when lit, and also lights the center ramp for a 2-mile shot for about 5 seconds. The innermost right in lane scores 5,000 points and gives credit for zone 7 when lit. The outermost right in lane scores 5,000 points and lights the spinner in the back of the game for 3,000 points per spin for a few seconds.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Each mile collected over the course of the game adds (1,000 x bonus multiplier) points to the bonus. Max miles is 99. Each side ramp made in the entire game so far adds 20,000 points to the bonus, and is not affected by the multiplier. The bonus multiplier is advanced each time a lock is lit for 3-ball multiball, in the order of 2x - 3x - 4x - 5x - 6x and light extra ball - 6x and light special. Bonus multiplier is also always carried over from ball to ball. </p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>In competition/tournament play, specials are worth a measly 100,000 points. Extra balls are either on or off, they cannot be set to have a point value.</p>

<p>The timer on the captive ball value, the lit spinner, and the lit center ramp can all be adjusted, to a maximum of 20 seconds. </p>

<p>The pop bumpers can start by all being off, or having any number of them lit or flashing, at the start of each ball.</p>

<p>The ability for the shelter to lock ball 1 toward 3-ball multiball can be always enabled, always disabled, or only enabled for the first multiball.</p>

<p>The first miles extra ball can be set to any value from 2 to 35 miles. The second miles extra ball can be set to anywhere from 10 to 69 miles. The miles special can be set to anywhere from 50 to 99 miles. Or, any or all of these three awards can be disabled.</p>
