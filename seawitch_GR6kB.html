<h1>Seawitch (Stern Electronics, 1980)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>At the beginning of the game, follow the bonus X around the playfield, since bonus multiplier carries from ball to ball (unless you max it out, then it partially resets). The order is 2X center, 3X lower left, 4X upper right, 5X center, 6X lower left, 7X upper right. Drop targets build the base bonus. Completing drop target banks for the first time on a ball advances the loop value, and completing all 3 lights extra ball. Completing any bank for the second time on a ball scores a bonus collect (without the multiplier). </p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Drop targets</h3>

<p>There are 3 banks: a 4-bank in the middle, a 3-bank in the lower left, and a 4-bank in the upper right. Each drop target always scores 1 bonus advance.<br>
If a bank has NOT been completed on the current ball, then the 1, 2, or 3 in front of it will be lit. This means that hitting each drop target will score and add to the current loop value. The loop value is 1,000 points for each lit insert in the large orbit, which maxes at 10,000 points.<br>
If a particular bank HAS been completed on the current ball already, the number in front will not be lit. This means each drop target only scores the current loop value, but does not add to it. When only one target is left standing in a bank that was previously completed on the current ball, it will be lit pink for Score Lit Bonus Value, which means that final drop target will be worth the current loop value PLUS the current base bonus count (without the multiplier). <br>
If the white X is lit in front of a bank, regardless of whether it has been completed on the current ball or not, that bank will advance the bonus multiplier the next time it is completed. The order in which the banks are lit for increase bonus X is set: 2X is at the center bank, 3X at the lower left bank, 4X at the upper right bank, 5X at the center, 6X at the left, 7X at the right. It's very important to chase the bonus multiplier early in a game, since it carries over from ball to ball.</p>

<p>If all three banks of targets are completed on the same ball, the in lanes will be lit for extra ball (50,000 points in tournament play) and the orbit will be lit for 2X Loop Value. </p>

<h3>Big loop</h3>

<p>A full plunge takes the ball around the big orbit loop. It can also be shot clockwise from the upper right flipper or counterclockwise from the lower left. Within the loop are 10 inserts that light individually, as well as one star rollover at the top. The rollover scores the loop value, which is equal to 1,000 points times the number of lit inserts within the loop (maximum 10,000). If no lights are lit, the star rollover scores 10 points only. One loop insert is lit for each individual drop target hit, but only in banks that have not been completed already on that ball. If all three banks of drop targets have been completed at least once on the current ball, the loop value collected at the star rollover is doubled to 20,000 points.</p>

<p>Not always, but most of the time, if the ball is going counterclockwise around the loop, holding up the upper left flipper will send the ball into the center drop targets, which will deflect it toward the lower right flipper for a relatively easy catch. This is not 100% consistent since it depends on the speed of the ball as it comes around, and it may not work on your Seawitch at all, but it's worth looking out for and trying as a way to get a fast moving ball under control, or at least slowed down.</p>

<h3>Star standups and spinner</h3>

<p>There are four standup targets with stars on them in the bumper area: three on the left, and one on the right near the upper right drop targets. Hitting an unlit standup scores 100 points and lights it. Hitting a lit standup scores 1,000 points and 1 bonus advance.</p>

<p>The spinner in the middle right of the playfield scores 200 points per spin, plus an additional 200 points/spin for each lit star standup target, for a maximum value of 1,000 points per spin. If bonus multiplier and base bonus are both maxed out, this is probably the best shot for more points on an already good ball.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Each individual drop target scores 1 bonus advance. Lit star standup targets score 1 bonus advance. The out lanes and the secret star rollover under the upper right flipper score 3 bonus advances.<br>Completing any drop target bank with a lit white X advances the bonus multiplier. Max bonus is 7x 39,000 = 273,000 points.<br>
Advancing the multiplier to either 6X or 7X (based on settings) will light the Specials around the playfield. Special can be lit on both out lanes and on the secret star rollover. Depending on game settings, the special will either move between all three of these locations, or it will always be on at the secret star and simply alternate between the out lanes in addition. Special is worth 100,000 points in competition play.<br>
Bonus multiplier is carried from ball to ball, but only up to 5X. If the bonus is advanced to 6X or 7X on a ball, it will be reset to 3X for the next ball.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the playfield</h3>

<p>Seawitch has a conventional in lane/out lane setup on both sides near the flippers. Out lanes score 5,000 points and 3 bonus advances, and also can be lit for Special if the bonus multiplier is advanced to 6X or 7X. The in lanes score 500 points and are lit for extra ball (either together or alternately) if all three sets of drop targets are completed at least once on the same ball.</p>

<p>Take note of the position of the upper right flipper and the fact that there's space (and even a rollover button) underneath it. If for some reason you are holding the right flipper up and the ball is in the vicinity of the top of the right slingshot, be sure not to release the right flipper at the wrong time and accidentally dunk the ball into the right out lane. This sounds like a niche situation, but depending on how you prefer to catch the ball to get it under control, it might be easier to do than you'd expect.</p>
