<h1 style="color:yellow;">Hi-Score / Super Score (Gottlieb, 1967)</h1>

<p>Hi-Score is the 4-player version. Super Score is the 2-player version. The two games have identical playfields, rules, and scoring.</p>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Shoot all of the lit A-B-C lanes and targets to increase the value of the As, Bs, and Cs on the big wheel, then spin that wheel as many times as you can by making the lit saucers in the center of the playfield or nudging your way into the lit lanes below the flippers when the ball inevitably ends up there.</p>

<br>

<h2>A note on this game's flippers</h2>

<p>Contrary to what basically every other game in pinball history has taught you, the left flipper button will flip both flippers in the left half of the table, and the right flipper button will flip both flippers in the right half of the table, regardless of what shape the flippers are or which direction they rotate. This will mess with your head as you play. It is impossible to flip just one flipper at a time out of a pair.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<p>Top green passive bumper - always scores 50 points.</p>

<p>Red pop bumpers - score 1 point, or 10 points when lit. Only two of the four will be lit at a time. There is a two-way gate between the two upper pop bumpers that scores 50 points when the ball travels through it.</p>

<p>A targets, B targets, and C lanes - always score 50 points. Hitting one of these lanes or targets when it is lit will unlight it and advance the score corresponding to that letter on the big wheel. The A is advanced from 5 to 50 to 500 points; the B is advanced from 50 to 500 to 1,000 points; the C is advanced from 500 to 1,000 to 2,000 points.</p>

<h3>Spin and the big wheel</h3>

<p>The saucers in the center of the playfield and the lanes underneath both sets of flippers always score 50 points. If they are lit, they will also spin the big wheel at the bottom center of the table. The wheel itself spins for a couple seconds, then a mini ball rolls around and lands on one of the switch cups labelled A, B, C, or Star. If the ball lands in A, B, or C, the currently lit value corresponding to that letter is award. If the ball lands in the Star, you get an extra ball. At the end of the ball, the A, B, and C values are all reset to their base levels.</p>

<h3>When are things lit?</h3>

<p>10-point switch hits alternate which features in the game are lit. This is trivial for the two saucers in the center of the playfield and the pairs of lanes underneath the flippers. For the pop bumpers, either the top left and bottom right ones are lit, or the top right and bottom left ones are lit; those two groups alternate and are mutually exclusive.</p>

<h3>Bonus?</h3>

<p>There is no end of ball bonus on Super Score, nor is there anything to carry over between balls, unless you consider a Spin received from a lit out lane to be a bonus. No score is given for landing in the Star space on the wheel to earn an extra ball; this wedge does nothing at all, then, if Same Player Shoots Again is already lit.</p>
