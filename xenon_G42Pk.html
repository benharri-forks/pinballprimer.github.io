<h1 style="color:blue;">Xenon (Bally, 1980)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>If the left flipper is strong enough to reliably make the ramp "tube" shot, and if the kickout from the left saucer is easily controllable, shoot the ramp all day for an increasing value of 5,000 points per shot up to a maximum of 90,000 apiece. <br>If one of those two things is not reliable, shoot the spinner until lock is lit at the ramp by 3 upper saucers and multiball is started at 6 upper saucers. Starting multiball lights the spinner for 1,000 a spin for the rest of the ball, which should then be the go-to shot. </p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top rollover buttons</h3>

<p>Each rollover button scores 1,000 points. If the nearby green light is flashing, that button also drops the corresponding drop target on the middle-right of the table.</p>

<h3>Top saucer</h3>

<p>Scores 5,000 points and (usually) lights an X symbol in the center of the playfield.<br>Lighting 3 X symbols lights the lock at the right ramp tube shot. If a ball is locked, completing another set of 3 X's starts multiball. The first two X's of the second set can be collected before locking a ball, meaning it's possible to hit the saucer 5 times, then lock a ball, then instantly have multiball ready at the saucer again.</p>

<p>During multiball, collecting one set of 3 X's will light both out lanes for special (worth 50,000 points in competition play). Each set of 3 X's collected in multiball after that will award a special directly.</p>

<h3>Left spinner</h3>

<p>Will usually be worth a measly 10 points per spin, but should be shot anyway if you're working toward multiball since it's the most reliable way to get to the top of the table to try for more top saucers. <br>When multiball is started, the spinner will be lit for 1,000 points per spin. Unless the tube shot value is rather high, make the lit spinner a priority.</p>

<h3>Right ramp tube shot</h3>

<p>The first shot toward the ramp scores 5,000 points, and increases the value by a further 5,000 points. The maximum value can be either 50,000 or 90,000, depending on game settings. When the value is maxed, the next ramp shot will also award a special (worth 50,000 in competition play as mentioned above). As another game setting, the ramp shot can either carry its value from ball to ball or reset back to 5,000 points between balls.</p>

<p>After one set of three X lights has been completed, the ramp will be lit for a lock. Shooting the ramp when lit still scores and advances the ramp shot value, but will lock the ball, and a second ball will be sent to the plunger. <br>Shooting the ramp after a ball is locked also still scores and advances the value, but as the second ball comes down the lane, the first ball will be kicked out and the second one will be held.</p>

<p>It is a common issue on Xenon for the flippers to wear out after being turned on and actively played for a long time, such as in an all-day tournament, as the coils heat up. This affects this table more than most, as the left flipper may become weak enough that the tube shot becomes very difficult. Keep this in mind when selecting a strategy.</p>

<h3>Right drop targets</h3>

<p>Each individual target scores 1,500 points. Completing the bank scores 10,000 points, lights one or both in lanes for 10,000 points, and also scores the lit award. One completion lights 2X bonus; the second light 4X bonus; the third scores an addition 25,000 points; the fourth awards an extra ball, which in tournament play is also 25,000 points; and each completion after the 4th awards a special. <br>Value is decent here, but it's less efficient and less controllable to complete the drops than it is to stick with repeated ramp or lit spinner shots. If bonus is high, maybe consider going for the 4X bonus, but chasing the drops beyond that isn't recommended.</p>

<p>The lit award for a drop target completion always resets to 2X bonus between balls, but the state of each individual drop is remembered. </p>

<h3>Xenon bonus</h3>

<p>Yellow arrows in the playfield point to two standups on the left side of the playfield, and then the drop targets. One of the yellow arrows will be lit at any time; hit that shot to move the arrow and advance the bonus by lighting one of the letters near the bottom of the playfield. The lit arrow always starts at the lower standup target, then moves to the upper standup target, then moves to the drops. When the lit arrow is pointing at the drop targets, shooting any drop will award the bonus advance. (The yellow standups also score 700 points, regardless of whether they're lit for bonus advance.)</p>

<p>Each lit letter at the bottom of the playfield scores 2,000 points in bonus. A total of 10 advances lights the 20,000 wizard bonus, and a total of 20 advances lights the 40,000 wizard bonus. Once the 40,000 wizard bonus is lit, getting ten further advances scores a special. All bonus, including the wizard bonuses, is multiplied by the bonus multiplier. <br>The game can be set to carry all bonus over from ball to ball, or only the wizard bonuses.<br>Max bonus value is 4x 58,000, or 232,000.</p>
