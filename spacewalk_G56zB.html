<h1>Space Walk (Gottlieb, 1979)</h1>

<p>This is the very rare electromechanical version of the playfield from Countdown (Gottlieb, 1979). It is mostly known for being the final electromechanical game from a major American manufacturer.</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Hit drop targets. Clear both sets of black targets OR both the red and blue targets to earn 2x bonus and light the in/out lanes. Clearing the black targets also lights extra ball at the top saucer. Clearing all targets lights the upper side lanes for specials. There is very little to do on this table once all drop targets are down, since they do not reset.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top saucer</h3>

<p>Scores 500 points and a bonus advance, plus an extra ball when lit after both banks of black drop targets have been cleared.</p>

<h3>Black drop targets</h3>

<p>Always score a bonus advance, as well as 500 points when not lit or 5,000 when lit. The black drop target banks are lit after both the red and blue banks have been cleared. Clearing both black drop target banks lights the top saucer for an extra ball, the in/out lanes, and 2x bonus.</p>

<h3>Upper side lanes</h3>

<p>Score 500 points and a bonus advance, as well as cleanly feeding the ball to the upper flipper. These lanes are lit for a special after all 4 drop target banks are completed.</p>

<h3>Red and blue drop target banks</h3>

<p>Always score a bonus advance, as well as 500 points when not lit or 5,000 when lit. These banks are lit after all black drop targets have been hit. Clearing both the red and blue banks lights 2x bonus and the in/out lanes.</p>

<h3>Advance Bonus rollovers</h3>

<p>The walls that form a funnel around the top saucer and the star rollovers in the center of the playfield are tied together. After hitting either funnel wall or either star rollover a total of 4 times, the star rollovers will remain lit for the rest of the ball. The star rollovers award a bonus advance when lit.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is advanced by any drop target, any out lane, and lit star rollovers. Max base bonus is 19,000 points.<br>On the final ball of the game, 2x bonus is given for free immediately, and clearing the red and blue drop targets or both banks of black drop targets increases the bonus multiplier for 3x. On all other balls, you start at 1x bonus, and clearing the red and blue targets or all black targets lights 2x bonus. You cannot get 3x bonus outside of the final ball of the game in any way, even by completing all 4 banks of drop targets. There is no mid-ball bonus collect or any way to carry over bonus or bonus multiplier between balls.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Space Walk has a conventional in/out lane setup. In lanes score 100 points, or 1,000 when lit. Out lanes always add a bonus advance, and score 500 points or 5,000 when lit. In and out lanes are lit for the remainder of the ball after completing both the red and blue target banks, or the two black target banks.</p>

<p>There is a center peg between the flippers.</p>

<h3>Final note</h3>

<p>Special can be worth a free game or an extra ball. Neither extra balls nor specials can have a point value.</p>
