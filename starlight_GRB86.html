<h1>Star Light (Williams, 1984)</h1>

<p>Comparable layout with, but somewhat different rules as, the widebody game Laser Ball (Williams, 1979).</p>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Complete the Star targets to light lock for multiball; complete the Light targets to increase the left spinner value to 1,000, then 2,000 per spin; lock a ball to instantly start 2-ball multiball. During multiball, all scoring is doubled, so collect some 4,000 point spinners where possible. Collecting all 10 numbers from the star rollovers or top lanes adds one constellation; constellations and star rollovers are your bonus, multiplied by the number of lit green targets/lanes you've made. 4 constellations lights extra ball at the right orbit, 6 constellations lights out lanes for special. There is lane change for the top lanes/which numbered stars are collected, but it uses a button separate from the flippers. Completing both Star and Light holds bonus to the next ball, or qualifies a bonus ball on the last ball of the game.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>The far left lane lights stars 1 and 2; the next lane lights stars 3 and 4; etc., until the far right lane lights stars 9 and 10. Rolling through a lane scores 2,000 points and lights any unlit stars assigned to that lane (which can be both at once). Pressing the second button on the right side of the cabinet will rotate which lanes have lit stars. Lighting all 10 stars will reset all top lanes to be completely unlit and advance one constellation.</p>

<h3>Star targets</h3>

<p>Score 1,000 points each. Hit an unlit target to light it. Light all 4 targets to light lock at the right saucer. Somewhat unexpectedly, these targets can be shot from either flipper, and a backhand may even be easier for some of them.</p>

<h3>Light targets and spinner</h3>

<p>L and I are on the far left, G-H-T are in the center of the table. Targets score 1,000 points each, hit an unlit target to light it. Spell Light to receive some awards. The first Light scores 10,000 points and increases the left spinner value to 1,000/spin. The second Light scores 30,000 and increases the spinner again, to 2,000 per spin. The third light just scores 50,000 points. The fourth Light and beyond score 100,000 points; the fourth Light also qualifies an extra ball at the right saucer. The value of completing Light persists from ball to ball.</p>

<p>Spelling both Star and Light once each on the same ball lights the right orbit for hold bonus.</p>

<h3>Star rollovers, and more about constellations</h3>

<p>Star rollovers always score 1,000 points. Activate a flashing star rollover to light it. The numbers on these rollovers correspond to the top lanes; the lane change button will move which star rollovers are lit instead of flashing. Lighting all 10 stars, via rollover or top lane, will add one constellation and unlight all stars. End of ball bonus is equal to 1,000 points per lit star, plus 10,000 points per lit constellation, all times the bonus multiplier. </p>

<p>Completing 4 constellations (up through Pisces) lights the right orbit for an extra ball. Completing 6 constellations (Gemini) lights the out lanes alternately for a special. Constellations are reset at the start of each ball unless Hold Bonus is collected.</p>

<h3>Right orbit</h3>

<p>Scores 5,000 points. Can be lit for Hold Bonus (by completing Star and Light once each on the same ball), extra ball (4 constellations), or a bonus multiplier.</p>

<h3>Right (lock) saucer and multiball</h3>

<p>This saucer scores 3,000 points for each lit star on the <i>current</i> constellation (completed constellations count for nothing). Completing Star will light this saucer for Lock. Collecting a 100,000-point completion of Light will qualify an extra ball at this saucer.</p>

<p>Locking a ball will cause another ball to be served to the plunger for a 2-ball multiball, which begins as soon as a second ball hits the switch. There are no multiball-specific scoring features, but all scoring is doubled as long as two balls are in play, so use this opportunity to collect completions of Light or big bucks at the spinner while their values are doubled. </p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is equal to 1,000 points per currently lit star, plus 10,000 points per completed constellation. Out of the standup target above and to the left of the bumpers, the right orbit, or the standup target below the right saucer, one of the three will always be lit green; hit this target to increase the bonus multiplier in the sequence 2x-3x-5x-10x. Each spin of the spinner will rotate where the lit bonus multiplier is. Max bonus is 5x 69,000 = 345,000 points.</p>

<p>Base bonus can be carried over to the next ball by completing both Star and Light on that ball, then shooting the right orbit. If Hold Bonus is collected on the final ball of the game, the award is a bonus ball instead; this bonus ball is timed and lasts 1 second for each 1,000 points of base bonus you earned, for a maximum of 69 seconds. The bonus ball is single ball play with unlimited ball save until time runs out. When time runs out, the flippers lock so the ball can drain immediately. I have not been able to verify what happens if a lock or an extra ball is lit during the bonus ball. You are awarded end of ball bonus when the bonus ball ends; however, the bonus you collected on your final regular ball of the game does not get recollected after the bonus ball.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Star Light has a conventional in/out lane setup. Out lanes score 20,000 points, in lanes score 5,000. Out lanes can be lit alternately for special by completing the 6th and final constellation.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>In competition/novelty play, specials are worth 50,000 points (I believe). Extra balls cannot be set to have a point value.</p>

<p>The top lanes can be set to only give 1 star at a time, even if both are unlit when you roll through a given lane.</p>

<p>The hold bonus at the right orbit can be set to expire after 5, 8, or 10 seconds, rather than being on until the end of the ball or being on until collected.</p>

<p>The game can start with none of the Light awards lit. In this case, the first Light completion scores 5,000, the second scores 10,000, etc. Spinner value is not affected by this setting.</p>
