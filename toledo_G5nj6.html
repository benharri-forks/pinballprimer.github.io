<h1 style="text-align:center">Toledo / Valencia (Williams, 1975)</h1>

<p>Toledo is the 2-player version. Valencia is the much mroe rare 4-player version.</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Collect A and B from the lower left and right standup targets, ignoring C and D, to light double bonus. Then, shoot the orbits repeatedly with the goal of making it up to the top saucer as many times as possible. Ignore the tempting 8-bank of targets in the middle unless you've hit the top saucer enough to light all 8 targets.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top saucer</h3>

<p>Always scores a base value of 500 points, and will be lit for one of two other awards, alternating on 10-point switch hits. Advance Bonus will, when lit, give either 1, 2, or 3 bonus advances, depending on game settings. If you make the saucer when Advance Bonus is lit but your bonus is already maxed out at 19,000 points, the saucer will be worth 5,000 points instead of 500. Spot Numbers will advance the lit center standup target by 2 steps when lit; if all 8 center targets are lit, the saucer scores 5,000 points again. Landing in this saucer as much as possible should be the main goal for most of the game.</p>

<h3>Orbits</h3>

<p>There are three rollover buttons in each orbit. From bottom to top, they score 10 points, then 100 points or advance bonus, then 500 points. One of the two orbits will have its 100 point button lit for advance bonus; this again alternates with each 10-point switch hit. Notice, then, that to get a bonus advance from an orbit, you want to shoot for the side whose center button is not lit, because the 10 point button in the front of the orbit will light the 100 point button on the way up. </p>

<h3>Center standup targets</h3>

<p>In the center of the table is a bank of 8 standup targets, which are actually made from flipper buttons; they're a little wider than most standup targets and the ball might not bounce off them in quite the same way. At the start of each ball, all targets score 100 points, and target #1 on the far left will be lit with an arrow. Hitting the target with an arrow on it, or spotting a number via the rollover button immediately in front of the target bank. will move the arrow to the right one position (or two, if it's a spot from the top saucer), and all targets to the left of the arrow will be lit white for 500 points instead of 100. Advancing the arrow all the way to position 5 or 7 (based on settings) lights the in lanes alternately for extra ball. If target #8 is spotted or hit when the arrow is lit, the arrow will turn off, and all 8 targets will be lit for 1,000 points and a bonus advance per hit for the rest of the ball, with a lit special on the out lanes. This entire sequence resets at the end of every ball.</p>

<p>As far as strategy is concerned, this bank is definitely too dangerous to shoot for when targets are 100 points, and it's debatably too dangerous when targets are 500 points. Don't use the upper flippers to shoot at the targets, because this puts the ball out of control with a lot of horizontal momentum. The ideal outcome is to receive Spot Numbers from the top saucer 4 times to spot all 8 targets, then hit any target to light them for 1,000 and a bonus advance, then shoot only for those targets where you know you can control the return feed safely.</p>

<h3>A-B-C-D targets</h3>

<p>Targets always score 500 points. Hit an unlit target to light it. Lighting A and B awards double bonus for that ball. Lighting A-B-C-D lights the in lanes alternately for extra ball.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Toledo has a conventional in/out lane setup. Out lanes score 1,000 points and a bonus advance, and can be lit alternately for special by lighitng all 8 center targets. In lanes score 500 points, and can be lit alternately for extra ball by completing A-B-C-D or lighting target 5 or 7 (game setting). There is always only one in lane lit for extra ball; you do not get both in lanes lit by completing both of the two ways to light an extra ball. Alternating features on the in/out lanes will toggle with each 10 point switch hit. If special and extra ball are both lit, they will always be lit on opposite sides.</p>

<p>Two rollover buttons near the tops of the slingshots score no points, but advance bonus when pressed. Be aware of strange feeds that may result from these buttons affecting the roll of a moving ball at the bottom of the table.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is advanced by lit 100 point buttons on the orbits, the out lanes, the rollover buttons near the slingshots, and the top saucer (the latter can give 1, 2, or 3 advances). Center standup targets also give 1 bonus advance each if all 8 have been lit. Max base bonus is 19,000 points. Bonus can be doubled on any ball by hitting both of the A and B standup targets. Max bonus is 2x 19,000 = 38,000 points. Bonus is a veyr large part of this game's scoring, and lighting double bonus should always be a priority. There is no carryover for any part of the bonus and there is no mid-ball bonus collect.</p>
