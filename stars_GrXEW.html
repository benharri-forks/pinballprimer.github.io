<h1 style="color:yellow;">Stars (Stern Electronics, 1978)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>If specials are worth points, shoot all the star standup targets to light specials and cash them in until you can't anymore. If specials aren't worth points or if specials are limited to one per ball and you've already cashed one, light a spinner of your choice and rip it or complete drop targets for their rewards.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Star targets</h3>

<p>Five in all around the playfield. Two are on either side of the bumper at the very top of the playfield; one is just above the spinner; and the last two are on either side of the lower-middle playfield. Hitting any target, whether lit or not, scores 500 points and 1 bonus advance. If it is lit, that star is collected and placed in front of the spinner. The spinner is worth 200 points per spin times the number of lit stars, so maxes at 1,000/spin. One star is always spotted at random to start the ball.</p>

<p>When all 5 stars are lit, a lit Special will roam between the five star targets, moving on switch hits. Special can be set to free game, extra ball, 100,000 points, or nothing. If it's worth points, make it a priority to get one. There are further settings that determine whether the star special can be cashed repeatedly or just once per ball, so go into your game knowing what these settings are set to if possible.</p>

<h3>Drop targets and left spinner</h3>

<p>Completing banks of drop targets gives awards in the following order. Note that even if an award requires only 1 of the 2 banks to be completed, both banks will be reset when the award is given.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Complete one of the two banks to light Double Bonus; then</li>
	<li>Complete both banks to light Triple Bonus; then </li>
	<li>Complete both banks to score a Wow, which awards an extra ball; then</li>
	<li>Each completion of both banks scores a Special.</li>
</ol>
<p>Game settings can heavily influence these rules. It is possible to set steps 1 and 2 to both require a single bank or both require both banks, and it is possible to set up the game to skip step 3 entirely so that the third award and on give a Special.</p>
<p>Individual drop targets score 500 points. Completing either bank scores 3,000 points.<br>If the left and right drop targets in a bank are hit but the center is kept standing, that center target becomes worth an additional 7,000 points.</p>
<p>The left spinner, which is between the two banks of targets, scores 200 points per spin, plus an additional 400 points per spin for each hit center target in the two banks. The value of this spinner does reset when the drop targets reset. This creates an interesting balance dynamic between whether to hit the center targets of each bank to advance the spinner value, or save the center targets to try to get the additional 7,000 points.</p>

<h3>In lanes, out lanes, and bonus</h3>

<p>In lanes and out lanes score 500 points when not lit, and 3,000 points plus 3 bonus advance when lit.</p>

<p>In addition to the star targets and bottom lanes, bonus is also advance when the ball goes over a lit rollover button. There are two of these; one smack in the middle of the playfield and one at the very top. Switch hits toggle whether the rollover buttons and bottom lanes are lit.<br>Maximum bonus is 3x 19,000 = 57,000, which is significant points in this game. Bonus multipliers can only be given from the drop targets as mentioned above, and bonus X does not carry over from ball to ball.</p>
