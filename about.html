<h1 style="color:white;">The Pinball Primer - About and FAQ</h1>

<h2>Who runs this website?</h2>

<p>The Pinball Primer was created and is primarily run by <b>solar_espeon</b> (me!). I don't play in tournaments yet due to my current location and other life stuff, but I plan to; for now I'm just a pinball hobbyist with a deep love of pinball history and rules, with a special interest in the early solid state era tables of 1975-1985. I'm the principal author of most of the pages on this website. You can contact me as solar_espeon on Twitter, Discord, or Instagram, or at aquaticespeon@gmail.com: I also frequent many pinball streams around Twitch.</p>

<p>Contributing with some pages as well as updates and additional information on pages I wrote is <b>Samantha Bacon</b>. Sammie (IFPA #59655) is one of the world's premier women pinball players, ranked #40 in the world and in the top 10 of four different U.S. states as of December 12, 2023. She has years of experience playing on tables from all eras at over 200 IFPA events.</p>

<h2>What's the goal of The Pinball Primer?</h2>

<p>The Pinball Primer is designed to be a one-stop shop for anyone looking to learn a pinball table of any era. Whether you're playing casually or in a tournament, and whether you're new to pinball or have years of experience, my vision is for The Pinball Primer to be a place where you can spend 30 seconds to quickly learn the strategy of any table you walk up to, or spend about 5 minutes deeply learning all the rules to truly understand how the game works.</p>

<h2>Why are you doing this? Doesn't [other resource] exist?</h2>

<p>Yes, other resources do exist, but spottiness in their coverage or quality is precisely why I want to make The Pinball Primer a thorough, go-to resource. Inspiration was taken from some of the following places:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://soldmy.org/emguide/index.php/Main_Page">The Bob Matthews EMcyclopedia.</a> Bob Matthews is one of the longest tenured and most knowledge pinball players of all time, with a competition career spanning many decades. He literally wrote the book on strategies for electromechanical tables- that's what is linked here, in wiki form. His "Quickie Version -> Full Detail" page setup directly inspired the layout of my pages. Unfortunately, his wiki doesn't cover any tables released after 1984, and on many tables, strategies that aren't necessarily competition-viable are omitted.</li>
	<li><a href="https://replayfoundation.org/papa/learning-center/player-guide/rule-sheets/">The PAPA/Replay Foundation rule sheets.</a> The Professional & Amateur Pinball Association hosts rulesheets for dozens and dozens of tables, primarily alphanumeric and 1990s DMD games, written by the best players in the world when those tables were new. Since they were written when the tables were new, though, many of them are 20-25 years old or older, and may have incomplete or incorrect rules, or outdated strategies. </li>
	<li><a href="https://pintips.net/">Pintips.</a> Pintips is a user submitted forum for super quick notes and strategies in pinball, but in my experience, the quality is inconsistent at best, as the 1-2 sentence posts can be unclear in what they're referring to or exclude strategies on tables that have multiple ways to play.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Pinball Primer was not created to plagiarize the hard work of any of these people; it is merely intended to compile, refine, and expand upon it to help lower the barrier of entry for anyone who wants to pick up, learn, or just generally have a good time playing the game of pinball.</li>

<h2>Why are so many of the current pages all from the late 70s and early 80s? Where are the guides for recent games from Stern, Jersey Jack, etc.?</h2>

<p>My (solar_espeon's) pinball interest lies the most in late electromechanical and early solid-state games. For me personally, they're the most fun and the easiest to learn, and they also take less time to write a detailed page on. Information on newer games is coming, but as this website is very new, I'm currently sticking with what I know best. (Also, a side note: as I write this in mid-December 2023, I haven't yet decided what approach to take with very new games that have multiple table layouts or are actively receiving code updates. More to come on that in the future.)</p>

<h2>Can I request that a specific table be added?</h2>

<p>Sure! Just don't expect it to be ready immediately. The Pinball Primer is a labor of love project that Sammie and I work on in our free time, and it takes a fair amount of that time to learn a table and then do the write-up on it. Feel free to reach out, though, and we'll do what we can.</p>
