<h1 style="color:white;">The Pinball Primer - About and FAQ</h1>

<h2>Who runs this website?</h2>

<p>The Pinball Primer was created and is primarily run by <b>solar_espeon</b> (me!). I don't play in tournaments yet due to my current location and other life stuff, but I plan to; for now I'm just a pinball hobbyist with a deep love of pinball history and rules, including a special interest in the games of the 1970s-90s. I'm the principal author of most of the pages on this website. You can contact me as solar_espeon on Twitter, Discord, or Instagram, or at aquaticespeon@gmail.com: I also frequent many pinball streams around Twitch.</p>

<p>Contributing with some pages as well as updates and additional information on pages I wrote is <b>Samantha Bacon</b>. Sammie (IFPA #59655) is one of the world's premier women pinball players, ranked #38 in the world as of March 27, 2024; she cracked the top 10 women's rankings in four different U.S. states for the 2023 season, and placed 3rd in the 2023 North Carolina Women's State Pinball Championship. She has years of experience playing on tables from all eras at over 200 IFPA events.</p>

<p>Additional credits and shoutouts go to arborelia (Elia Lake; IFPA #92725), GlitchCat7, and TerpohGaming for their feedback and assistance.</p>

<h2>What's the goal of The Pinball Primer?</h2>

<p>The Pinball Primer is designed to be a one-stop shop for anyone looking to learn a pinball table of any era. Whether you're playing casually or in a tournament, and whether you're new to pinball or have years of experience, my vision is for The Pinball Primer to be a place where you can spend 30 seconds to quickly learn the strategy of any table you walk up to, or spend about 5 minutes deeply learning all the rules to truly understand how the game works.</p>

<h2>Why are you doing this? Doesn't [other resource] exist?</h2>

<p>Yes, other resources do exist, but spottiness in their coverage or quality is precisely why I want to make The Pinball Primer a thorough, go-to resource. Inspiration was taken from some of the following places:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://rules.silverballmania.com/home">The Bob Matthews EMcyclopedia.</a> Bob Matthews is one of the longest tenured and most knowledgeable pinball players of all time, with a competition career spanning many decades. He literally wrote the book on strategies for electromechanical tables- that's what is linked here, in wiki form. His "Quickie Version -> Full Detail" page setup directly inspired the layout of my pages. Unfortunately, his wiki doesn't cover any tables released after about 1985, and on many tables, some strategies or scoring features that aren't necessarily competition-viable are omitted or have their details incorrect.</li>
	<li><a href="https://replayfoundation.org/papa/learning-center/player-guide/rule-sheets/">The PAPA/Replay Foundation rule sheets.</a> The Professional & Amateur Pinball Association hosts rulesheets for dozens and dozens of tables, primarily alphanumeric and 1990s DMD games, written by the best players in the world when those tables were new. Since they were written when the tables were new, though, many of them are 20-25 years old or older, and may have incomplete or incorrect rules, or outdated strategies. </li>
	<li><a href="https://pintips.net/">Pintips.</a> Pintips is a user submitted forum for super quick notes and how-tos in pinball, but in my experience, the quality is inconsistent at best, as the 1-2 sentence posts can be unclear in what they're referring to or exclude discussion on tables that have multiple ways to play.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Pinball Primer was not created to plagiarize the hard work of any of these people; it is merely intended to compile, refine, and expand upon it to help lower the barrier of entry for anyone who wants to pick up, learn, or just generally have a good time playing the game of pinball.</li>

<h2>Why are so many of the current pages all from the late 70s and early 80s? Where are the guides for recent games from Stern, Jersey Jack, etc.?</h2>

<p>My (solar_espeon's) pinball interest lies the most in late electromechanical and early solid-state games. For me personally, they're the most fun and the easiest to learn, and they also take less time to write a detailed page on. Information on newer games is coming, but as this website is still relatively new, I'm currently sticking with what I know best. (Also, a side note: as I write this in March 2024, I haven't yet decided what approach to take with very new games that have multiple table layouts or are actively receiving code updates. More to come on that in the future.)</p>

<h2>Why are so few Gottlieb games from the solid-state era onwards included?</h2>

<p>A very helpful supplemental resource used in creating these guides are the original manuals to the respective games. Manuals for most pinball games released since the 1960s have been scanned and uploaded to the Internet Pinball Database (<a href="https://ipdb.org">ipdb.org</a>). However, the people who hold the rights to the Gottlieb company name are inexplicably much more strict about copyrighted materials relating to their games, and are very quick to strike down internet distributions of schematics, parts lists, ROMs, and manuals that they are not able to make money off of, even though the company has been out of business for nearly thirty years. This means that writing a guide for any Gottlieb brand table with a complex ruleset that meets my own quality expectations would take significantly more time to produce. That doesn't mean they're not coming; it just means they're less practical to do. I expect similar issues to arise in the future with any Jersey Jack brand games that I hope to include guides for on this website, due to their desire to prevent the virtual pinball community from making virtual recreations from their games.</p>

All copyrighted terms, names of licensed games, etc., belongs to their respective owners. The information disseminated on this website is for educational purposes only.</p>

<h2>Why do multiple links on the Game List page go to the same guide page?</h2>

<p>Pinball games get re-released for a myriad of reasons, such as having both solid state and electromechanical versions, having versions with different numbers of players, trying to recapitalize on the success of a previously successful layout, or updating a licensed game in time with the release of other related media. If a table was released multiple times under different names with minimal rules changes, they appear under all different names on the game list and are counted separately to help a player that may not know that a game they're looking at has a "sister title", but the different links lead to the same page for efficiency's sake. Such guide pages that detail a table with multiple releases will include notes on the different versions of that game at the top of the page.</p>

<h2>Can I request that a specific table be added?</h2>

<p>Sure! Just don't expect it to be ready immediately. The Pinball Primer is a labor of love project that Sammie and I work on in our free time, and it takes a fair amount of that time to learn a table and then do the write-up on it. Feel free to reach out, though, and we'll do what we can.</p>
