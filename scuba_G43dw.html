<h1>Scuba (Gottlieb, 1970)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Shoot between the pop bumpers as much as possible to try to complete sets of lit arrow standup targets until the plateau is advanced to full and everything on the table is lit. Once 4th plateau is reached, just keep the ball at the top of the playfield and do everything in your power to not center drain.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>Score 50 points, or 300 when lit. They are lit one at a time, from left to right, by achieving the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th plateaus respectively.</p>

<h3>Bullseye "arrow" standups</h3>

<p>Always score 50 points per hit. Lit targets will unlight when hit. Unlighting all targets advances the plateau value. The second and fourth targets are the only ones that can be shot directly; the others require pop bumper bounce luck. <br>Some targets are spotted on later balls, following this sequence for 5-ball play:</p>
<ul>
	<li>ball 1: no targets spotted</li>
	<li>ball 2: leftmost target spotted</li>
	<li>ball 3: leftmost and rightmost targets spotted</li>
	<li>ball 4 and 5: leftmost, rightmost, and center targets spotted</li>
</ul>
<p>and this sequence on 3-ball play:</p>
<ul>
	<li>ball 1: no targets spotted</li>
	<li>ball 2: leftmost and rightmost targets spotted</li>
	<li>ball 3: leftmost, rightmost, and center targets spotted</li>
</ul>
<p>Any targets that are spotted on the current ball number will start out spotted for any set on that ball. This makes it very easy to collect plateaus quickly in the final balls of the game, since each one only requires two targets, and it's the two that are easiest to collect.</p>

<h3>Yellow standups</h3>

<p>There is one on either side of the set of 5 arrow targets. They always score 100 points, and have nothing to do with the arrow targets themselves.</p>

<h3>Bumpers</h3>

<p>The red bumpers score 1 point, or 10 when lit. They are lit by achieving the 1st plateau.<br>The yellow bumper scores 10 points, or 100 when lit. It is lit only upon collecting the 4th plateau.</p>

<h3>Middle lane set</h3>

<p>Four more lanes, with two on the left and two on the right. Just like the top lanes, these score 50 points or 300 when lit, and are lit one at a time from left to right with each plateau advance. The first three lanes are standard rollover lanes that the ball can go through from either direction, but the far rightmost lane is a free replunge, directing the ball into the shooter lane. It's pretty difficult to get the ball to go through any of these lanes.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Scuba has no in lanes. The flippers back up directly to the bottom of the slingshots. This game has a thin rail slingshot instead of a standard shaped triangle one on both sides. This makes room for two out lanes on each side under each slingshot. These four lanes work identically to the middle and top rollover lane sets, scoring 50 points or 300 when lit, and being lit one at a time from left to right with each plateau advance. <br>The rail slingshots score 10 points apiece.<br>No points are awarded for a center drain. <br>There is no end of ball bonus.</p>
