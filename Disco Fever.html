<h1 style="color:orange;">Disco Fever (Williams, 1978)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Advance the bonus with lit top lanes, the standups in the upper right, the drop targets, and the in lanes. Collect bonus multipliers by spelling Disco at the upper left and upper right standups. <br>If extra balls and specials are important to you, light the extra ball after spelling Fever twice, then keep spelling Fever to light out lane specials or score specials directly.</p>

<br>

<h2>Flippers</h2>

<p>That's right, they get their own section with a big text heading! If your Disco Fever has normal looking flippers, skip this section.</p>

<p>Disco Fever was manufactured as one of only two games (the other being Time Warp) to have curved flippers, sometimes called banana flippers or banana bats, instead of conventional flippers. They were designed to make the ball easier to catch and trap, and they do that, but they also mess pretty badly with most conventional flipper instincts. Shots are going to feel like they are much later on a curved flipper than a normal one; shots that were late to begin with may not even be possible, and early shots on a curved flipper open a whole new world of backhand shots.<br>Tap passes are pretty much impossible. Post transfers are much more difficult. Ski jump passes tend to require less inbound speed on the ball to be effective.<br>In general, get a feel for how curved flippers affect your play on your Disco Fever before going for serious high score attempts or playing it in a tournament setting, if possible.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>Top lanes score 500 points, the A or B if lit white, and a bonus advance if lit orange. Which lane is lit orange for a bonus advance alternates with any 10 or 100 point switch hit.</p>

<h3>Upper right standup targets</h3>

<p>Each score 100 points. One gives a bonus advance with each hit, and the other gives a letter in Disco with each hit. Spelling Disco advances the bonus multiplier. It's fairly common to get some good bumper action and hit one or both of these repeatedly.</p>

<h3>Upper left standup and horseshoe</h3>

<p>Going through the horseshoe from either direction scores 5,000 points. <br>The horseshoe will be lit for Spot Bonus X half the time, alternating with 10 or 100 point switch hits. Scoring a bonus multiplier in this way preserves progress on Disco letters.<br>After two completions of the Fever drop targets, the horseshoe will be lit for extra ball. Extra ball does not score any points in competition play.</p>

<p>In front of the horseshoe is a standup target. Each hit to this target spots a letter in the word Disco. Completing Disco advances the bonus multiplier to 2X, 3X, then 5X. Any further completions score 5,000 points.</p>

<h3>Fever targets</h3>

<p>Three are on the middle left of the game, and the remaining two are dead center. Each target scores 1,000 points and a bonus advance. <br>Completing Fever once lights the number 1, which does nothing besides reset the targets. A second completion lights extra ball at the horseshoe. The third completion lights the out lanes alternately for special, and the 4th completion and on award a special directly. In competition play, special can be set to 10,000 points.</p>

<p>A game setting allows the 1 and 2 to be awarded together, meaning everything described in the previous paragraph needs one less completion of Fever to occur.</p>

<h3>A-B, left side lane, and the right side standup</h3>

<p>The letter A can be scored from the left top lane or the left in lane. B can be scored by the right top lane and right in lane. Either letter can be spotted by the left side lane, which also scores 5,000 points.</p>

<p>Each completion of A-B advances the value of the far right standup target. It begins at 5,000, and advances to 10,000, then 15,000, 20,000, and 30,000. Collecting the value by hitting the standup resets its value to 5,000. <br>Don't go out of your way trying for this unless the value happens to be built up to 20,000 or 30,000 over a long ball.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Conventional in lane-out lane setup. In lanes score 500 points, advance bonus once, and score either A or B on left and right respectively. Out lanes score 1,000 points and can be lit for special with three completions of Fever.<br>See the top of the page for a description on the curved flippers, if your local Disco Fever has them.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is advanced at the top lanes, the in lanes, and the upper right advance bonus target. Notice that each bonus advance contributes 2,000 to base bonus, not 1,000. <br>Bonus multiplier is collected at the upper left horseshoe when Score Bonus X is lit, or by spelling Disco at the upper two standups. <br>Max bonus is 5x 38,000 = 190,000. </p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>Bonus count and bonus multiplier are not carried from ball to ball, but the value of the right side standup and progress toward both A-B and Disco are kept.</p>

<p>Special, when worth points, scores 10,000. As far as I can find, extra ball cannot be set to be worth points.</p>

<p>The 1 and 2 can be linked together, meaning that extra ball, out lane special, and award special occur after 1, 2, and 3+ completions of the Fever targets rather than 2, 3, and 4+, respectively.</p>
