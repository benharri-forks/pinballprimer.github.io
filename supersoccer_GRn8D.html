<h1>Super Soccer / Soccer (Gottlieb, 1975)</h1>

<p>Not to be confused with Soccer (Williams, 1964). Super Soccer is the 4-player game, while regular Soccer is the otherwise identical 2-player version.</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Everything on Super Soccer gets more valuable as the game goes on, but the preferred strategy always stays the same. If the current bonus is not maxed out at 10,000, use the left flipper to shoot a center spinner, and use the right flipper to land in the Mystery Bonus Advance saucer at the upper left turnaround. If the current bonus is maxed out, as shown by 10 marbles in the backglass, do whatever it takes to get the ball to the right flipper and shoot for the Scores Bonus saucer in the upper left turnaround.</p>

<br>

<h2>Balls per game note</h2>

<p>On Super Soccer, more and more features are lit based on the current ball number. When lit features are described in this guide, they will assume the game is on 5-ball settings. If the game is set to 3-ball settings, ball 1 is identical to ball 3 of a 5-ball game, ball 2 is identical to ball 4 of a 5-ball game, and ball 3 is identical to ball 5 of a 5-ball game.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>Top lanes score 100 points, or 500 plus 1 bonus advance when lit. On balls 1 and 2, only the rightmost lane is lit. Balls 3, 4, and 5 each light one additional lane, from right to left. Be especially careful of making the second lane from left, as it is possible for a ball through that lane to go between the bumpers, through the right spinner, and SDTM.</p>

<p>To the left of the top lanes is a star rollover that says Light Special Target. Making this rollover lights a standup target in the upper right of the playfield for a special. The special target will unlight itself if any switch in the game other than one of the center spinners is hit.</p>

<h3>Upper left turnaround lane</h3>

<p>There are two different saucers in the turnaround lane. The near one scores 1,000 points plus the full bonus with multiplier (2x on ball 2 of a 3-ball game or ball 5 of a 5-ball game, or 3x on ball 3 of a 3-ball game); collecting the bonus in this way resets the bonus back to 0 points. The far saucer will score 500 points and 1 bonus advance either 1, 2, or 3 times randomly. Max bonus is 10,000 points (10 backglass marbles) at all times. Shooting these saucers and being able to nudge into the one you want is paramount to a high score.</p>

<h3>Bumpers</h3>

<p>Bumpers always score 100 points.</p>

<h3>Center spinners</h3>

<p>Base spinner value is 10 points per spin in 5-ball play and 100 points per spin in 3-ball play. Every 5th spin of either spinner, as indicated by the yellow lights in front of the spinners, scores 500 points and a bonus advance. Note that while the game is counting off those 500 points, further spins of the spinner will not register toward the next bonus advance.</p>

<h3>Upper side lanes</h3>

<p>Score 100 points when not lit, or 500 plus a bonus advance when lit. They are lit on balls 4 and 5 only. The right side lane also opens the gate, which redirects a ball from the right out lane back to the shooter lane. The gate is open until used or until the end of the ball.</p>

<h3>Lower standup targets</h3>

<p>Also score 100 points, or 500 and a bonus advance when lit. These are lit on balls 3, 4, and 5. They are far too dangerous to shoot for directly. If the slingshot bonks the ball into one, consider it a nice boost, but don't aim for these as a way to build your bonus. </p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Super Soccer has a conventional in/out lane setup. Out lanes score 1,000 points. In lanes score 100 points or 500 and a bonus advance when lit; they are only lit on the final ball of the game. <br>There is a gate in the right out lane that directs the ball back to the shooter lane. This gate moves the ball <i>before</i> scoring the 1,000 points from the out lane. The gate is opened by the upper right side lane and closed at the end of the ball or after being used.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is advanced by any lit rollover lane or target, the Mystery Advance saucer, or every 5th spin of either spinner. There is no skill method for increasing bonus multiplier. In a 3-ball game, bonus is doubled on ball 2 and tripled on ball 3. In a 5-ball game, bonus is doubled on ball 5. Bonus is 1,000 points per marble showing on the backglass, maximum of 10. The full bonus including multiplier can be collected at any time from the Scores Bonus saucer in the upper left turnaround. Collecting the bonus mid-ball resets the base bonus back to 0. There is no way to hold base bonus.</p>
