<h1 style="color:green;">Wild Card (Williams, 1977)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>If playing strictly for points: shoot the left orbit twice to light the spinner and double bonus, then focus on the spinner from the left flipper while continuing to make orbits from the right, nudging into the top saucer when you do.<br>If playing for game progress/specials: complete the Aces and Deuces from the top targets, upper side lane, and lower saucers. The first set of aces <i>or</i> deuces each increase the value of the upper right kicker lane; the first set of aces <i>and</i> deuces lights special at the kicker lane; two sets of aces and deuces lights the out lanes alternately for a special.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Skill shot: top saucer</h3>

<p>The top saucer scores 10,000 points and a bonus advance. Try to end up here via controlled power or nudging on every plunge and after every right orbit shot.</p>

<h3>Ace and Deuce targets</h3>

<p>The three standup targets in the top of the table each score 1,000 points and correspond to two Aces and one Deuce. A second Deuce is in a side lane in the upper right, which scores 5,000. The remaining two Aces are in a saucer on the left side. Entering the saucer scores 5,000 points, a bonus advance, and awards one of the lit Aces. A saucer in the lower right functions identically for Deuces.</p>

<p>Complete one set of four Aces and four Deuces to light the upper right kickback lane for a special. Complete two sets of four Aces and four Deuces to light the out lanes alternately for a special. Specials can score a free game or an extra ball.</p>

<h3>Upper right kicker lane</h3>

<p>This lane is impossible to shoot for directly, and the ball usually only ends up here from a lucky bounce off the right pop bumper. At the start of the game, this lane scores 10,000 points and 1 bonus advance. After completing the 4 Aces <i>or</i> the 4 Deuces once, this lane's value increases to 20,000 points plus 2 bonus advances. Completing both the Aces and Deuces once lights this lane for a Special one time, while also increasing its value to a permanent 30,000 points plus 3 bonus advances.</p>

<h3>Left orbit</h3>

<p>The first shot to this orbit lights the center spinner. The second shot to this orbit lights double bonus. This is the go-to shot from the right flipper at pretty much all times. When the ball gets to the top of the playfield, nudge when you can to pick up another top saucer. If the ball chokes up near the top of this orbit without going through the one way gate at the top, it's possible to trigger the switch going up and going down, allowing you to light the spinner and 2x bonus with one shot.</p>

<h3>Center spinner</h3>

<p>Scores 100 points per spin, or 1,000/spin when lit. Light it by shooting the left orbit once. The spinner is off-center just enough that missed shots directly at the spinner are less of a drain risk than you'd expect. Shooting the spinner sends the ball clear up the center of the playfield, between the bumpers and toward the top saucer. This spinner can be shot from either flipper, but it's an easier shot to make and the spinner rips better if you do so from the left.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Wild Card has a conventional in/out lane setup. In lanes always score 5,000 points. Out lanes always score 10,000 points, and are lit alternately for a special after completing the Aces and Deuces twice. Collecting the out lane special resets the Aces and Deuces sets, allowing you to collect both specials again.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is advanced by any saucer (always 1 advance) or the upper right kicker lane (1, 2, or 3 advances, depending on whether sets of Aces and/or Deuces have been completed so far). Notice that a single bonus advance is worth 5,000 points on this game rather than the traditional 1,000. The only bonus multiplier is a double bonus, which is collected by making the left orbit two times in a single ball. Max bonus is 2x 50,000 = 100,000 points. There is no mid-ball bonus collect, and neither the base bonus nor the double bonus light can be carried over from ball to ball.</p>
