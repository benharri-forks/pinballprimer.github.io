<h1 style="color:blue;">2001 / Dimension / Galaxie (Gottlieb, 1971)</h1>

<p>2001 is the Replay version. Dimension is the Add-a-Ball version manufactured for domestic release in the USA. Galaxie is the Add-a-ball version manufactured for European export. Scoring in the replay and add-a-ball variants follow nearly identical rules; all scoring on Dimension and Galaxie is 10x that of 2001. Other minor rule changes related to the Add-a-Ball mechanics are mentioned at the end of this guide.</p>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Never ever shoot for the standups in the center. Repeatedly send the ball back up top, trying to complete colours with good bank shots and nudging. Plunge into the center saucer at the top until a colour is finished, then plunge into any lit saucer after that.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top saucers</h3>

<p>Five of them in a line, coloured red-blue-white-green-yellow. The white one scores 300 points, or a special when lit. The others score 50 points, or 300 when lit. How saucers are lit is mentioned in the next section...

<h3>Drop targets and center targets</h3>

<p>TWENTY of them (!?) arranged in two groups of ten on either side of the playfield. The five lower left targets are red; the five upper left targets are blue; the five upper right targets are green; and the five lower right targets are yellow. Each drop target down scores 50 points. Hitting two at once probably still only scores 50 points total due to how EM score motors work. </p>

<p>Completing any colour lights the corresponding top saucer and in/out lane for 300 points instead of 50. Completing multiple colours (typically 2 colours on 3-ball play and 3 colours on 5-ball play, though there may be additional settings that affect this) lights the center top saucer and one of the four center standup targets for special. Which center target is lit for special rotates with 10-point switch hits. Unlit center targets score 50 points.</p>

<p>Do not directly shoot for the 4 standup targets in the middle unless 1) you are absolutely certain you can hit the target lit for special, and 2) you're playing casually/on location where specials actually matter since they give no points. The whole structure in the middle of the playfield is a massive drain risk; always shoot up the sides of the playfield when the ball is on a flipper in relative control.</p>

<h3>Bumpers</h3>

<p>Two at the top of the playfield. 10-point switch hits alternate whether they're lit or not. Hitting one scores 10 points when not lit and 100 points when lit.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>2001 has a conventional in lane/out lane setup. The left out lane has a red light; left in lane has a blue one; right in lane has green, and right out lane has yellow. All in/out lanes score 50 points, unless they are lit by completing the drop targets of the corresponding colour, in which case they score 300.</p>

<p>If a ball shot at a drop target suddenly loses its momentum and falls straight down- which can happen if it hits the side of the drop target above the one that was shot at- be ready for a nudge or the ball might end up bouncing off the top of the sling and going out lane.</p>

<h2>Changes between introduced in Dimension and Galaxie, the add-a-ball versions</h2>

<p>On Dimension/Galaxie, scoring rules are the same, except everything has an extra 0 added to the end, just for funsies.</p>

<p>When the requisite number of colours is completed on Dimension/Galaxie, the following changes from 2001 can be seen:</p>
<ul>
	<li>An extra ball is scored immediately. 2001 does not immediately award its special just for clearing colours.</li>
	<li>The top saucer lights for Wow (extra ball), as well as <i>two</i> of the four center standups in the middle of the table, not just one.</li>
	<li>When the ball is drained when any Wows are lit, they will unlight and all completed colours of drops will reset before the next ball. On 2001, drop targets never reset mid-game, and once the specials are on, they're on for good.</li>
</ul>
