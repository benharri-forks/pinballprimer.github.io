<h1>Aladdin's Castle (Bally, 1976)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>The primary shot on Aladdin's Castle is the spinner shot back to the top of the table. Repeat this until at least A-B-C-D ahs been completed, so that double bonus, lit spinner, and extra ball have all been collected. The left horseshoe shot is also viable depending on a couple things: how dangerous the feed out of the horseshoe is, and whether the value stops at a repeatable 5,000 or a repeatable special. The feed out of the bumpers is one of the most dangerous parts of the game, so be ready to stop the ball from getting rifled down the middle of the right out lane.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes and rollovers</h3>

<p>The A-B-C-D top lanes each score 300 points and light the corresponding star rollovers; there are two sets of four rollovers, one above these lanes and one in the center of the table. Unlit star rollovers score 100 points. Lit star rollovers score 1 bonus advance as well as either 100 points in a 5-ball game or 1,000 points in a 3-ball game. <br>Lighting A and B will light the spinner and the out lanes. Lighting C and D lights double bonus. Lighting all four of A-B-C-D scores an instant extra ball.</p>

<h3>Bumpers</h3>

<p>Always score 100 points.</p>

<h3>Right spinner</h3>

<p>Scores 10 points per spin when not lit, or 100 per spin when lit after collecting the A and B letters.</p>

<h3>Left horseshoe shot</h3>

<p>It's technically possible to shoot either side of the horseshoe, but it's more intended and recommended to shoot up the left side of the horseshoe closer to the edge of the table. The ball will come down the side closer to the bumpers, usually directly at the left flipper but sometimes toward the left slingshot or the center drain. The ball usually proceeds slow enough that you'll have time to react to any of these. The horseshoe itself scores and advances the lit value on the table. The first 6 horseshoe shots always score 500 - 1,000 - 2,000 - 3,000 - 4,000 - 5,000. On liberal settings, every horseshoe shot starting with the 7th scores a special. On conservative settings, the progression continues special - 5,000 - special, and every horseshoe shot starting with the 10th scores 5,000 points. After collecting the A and B letters, the out lanes will also be lit to score and advance the horseshoe value.</p>

<h3>Side standup targets</h3>

<p>Score 300 points and a bonus advance.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>The left side of the table bottom is standard. The out lane scores 1,000 points, or the current horseshoe value if lit by collecting A and B. The in lane always scores 300 points and a bonus advance. <br>On the right side of the table bottom, there is a double flipper (with the possibility of a scissor drain between the flippers) and no in lane. The right out lane is the same as the left. There is no right side slingshot. </p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is advanced by lit star rollovers, the left in lane, and the two standup targets. Bonus can be doubled by collecting the C and D letters on the same ball. Max bonus is 2x 15,000 = 30,000 points. There is no way to carry bonus or multiplier from ball to ball, nor is there any mid ball bonus collect.</p>

<h3>Settings notes</h3>

<p>The Special award can be set to a free game or an extra ball. There is no way to set the special or the A-B-C-D extra ball to be worth points instead.</p>

<p>See the Left horseshoe shot section for details on the settings for the horseshoe shot score progression.</p>
