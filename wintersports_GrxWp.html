<h1 style="color:blue;">Winter Sports (Zaccaria, 1978)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>If the center saucer's kickout is safe, whack the ball up the middle through the spinner to make this saucer, scoring 5,000 points and increasing the spinner value up to a possible 1,000/spin. If the top center saucer ejects the ball straight down the middle, focus instead on the left side standup targets, which can be worth 10,000 <i>each</i> after 2 completions of the bank.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top center saucer</h3>

<p>Scores 5,000 points, advances bonus, and advances the spinner value from 10 to 100 points per spin or from 100 to 1,000 points per spin. The first shot into this saucer on each ball also lights the two candy cane lanes: double bonus on the left, and 5,000 points on the right.</p>

<h3>Top lanes, on either side of the saucer</h3>

<p>Score 500 points and advance the bonus. One of the two lanes will be lit, alternating with pop bumper hits. Going through a lit top lane lights the corresponding out lane for an extra ball. Both out lanes can be lit for an extra ball by going through one lit top lane, moving the light to the other top lane, and then rolling over that lane as well.</p>

<h3>Green standup targets</h3>

<p>Score 100 points and advance the bonus.</p>

<h3>Bumpers</h3>

<p>Score 100 points, or 1,000 when flashing. They cannot be solidly lit. Hit the Flash Bumpers right drop target to start them flashing.</p>

<h3>Left arch lane</h3>

<p>Scores 2,000 points. If the top center saucer has been made at least once on the current ball, this lane lights 2x bonus.</p>

<h3>Right arch lane</h3>

<p>Always scores 1 bonus advance. Alongside that bonus advance is 1,000 points if the lane is not lit, or 5,000 if it is; light this lane by making the center top saucer, as well.</p>

<h3>Center spinner</h3>

<p>Scores 10 points per spin, at first. The first two top saucer shots on a ball increase the spinner value to 100/spin, then 1,000/spin. Get the spinner value high as early as possible.</p>

<h3>Flash Bumpers target</h3>

<p>In addition to doing exactly what it says it does, this target scores 10,000 points. and it stays down- does not re-raise for the rest of the ball.</p>

<h3>Left side standup targets</h3>

<p>Each target, whether lit or unlit, scores 100 points at first. Hit a lit target to light it. Lighting all 5 targets once increases their value to 1,000 each. Lighting all 5 targets a second time increases their value again to 10,000 each. A third completion resets the value back to 100, but starts one of the targets flashing; hit the flashing target for a Special. <br>If you're going purely for points, complete this bank twice but not three times so you can milk 10,000 point targets for as long as possible.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Winter Sports has a conventional in/out lane setup, but with cut off in lanes to allow a ball going down an out lane to be nudged back into play. The exact shape of the in lane rail means that it's possible, but not very likely, for a ball to roll up a flipper and fall into the out lane. Most of the time, the in lane rail gap is purely for saving an out lane ball, using the posts in the out lane area.<br>All in and out lanes advance the bonus. In lanes score 500 points. Out lanes score 3,000 points and can be lit for extra ball by going through the corresponding lit top lane.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is advanced by the green standup targets near the bumpers, the right arch lane, and any in/out lane. Bonus is doubled by going through the left arch lane after it has been lit via a saucer shot. Max bonus is 2x 19,000 = 38,000 points. Bonus and bonus multiplier may never be carried from ball to ball. A setting in the game allows a mega bonus multiplier to be in play on the final ball of the game; the word ON will be lit or not on the backglass, alternating with switch hits (I presume). If you drain with the word ON lit, your bonus is multiplier by a further 10, which can stack with the earned double bonus. There is no mid-ball bonus collect.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>Special can be set to award a free game, an extra ball, 50,000 points, or "superbonus". The superbonus does not have anything to do with pinball itself; it could be used in certain parts of Europe to signify to an attendant that a player needed to be rewarded for their play with, for example, a free drink. In modern practice, this would just be a way to make special worth nothing. If you're lucky enough to see one of these games in the flesh at all, let alone in a tournament, I believe the special or the 50,000 points would be the best and most likely awards.</p>

<p>There is always a maximum of 1 extra ball per ball in play.</p>
