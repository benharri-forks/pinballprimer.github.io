<h1 style="color:lightcyan;">South Park (Sega, 1999)</h1>

<p><u>AUTHOR'S NOTE for anyone unfamiliar with the TV show South Park:</u> despite how it may look like a children's cartoon, South Park is a very mature franchise, and both the show and this pinball table are at times deliberately offensive. I have tried to remove gross/NSFW references from this guide to the greatest extent possible.</p>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>The best souce of points in this game is the Spooky Vision mini-wizard mode that is qualified by playing, but not completing, all 5 of the main character modes. Start modes by repeatedly making the shot assigned to a character 4 times for the first playthrough, and one additional time for subsequent replays: the mode shots are Stan at the left orbit between the bumpers, Chef at the center lane, Kenny at the doll toy, Kyle at the right ramp, and Cartman at the right hole. Make sure you <i>don't</i> complete at least one of these; Kenny is the least valuable, but Kyle is the easiest to fail. Short of playing all 5 modes and making it to Spooky Vision, there are moderate points available from multiball; shoot the toilet repeatedly to start it, make any shot to earn jackpots, after 5 jackpots the right ramp will be lit for a super jackpot worth 5x the regular jackpot, and collecting a super jackpot will increase the standard jackpot by 1,000,000 points.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Skill shot</h3>

<p>The skill shot is a precise-power plunge to one of the standup targets situated just below the Toilet targets. One of the targets will be lit; hit that one for 5,000,000 points, plus an additional 5,000,000 for each previously made skill shot in the game so far. If you choose to ignore the skill shot and full plunge the ball instead, the ball should always hit one of the targets on the toilet itself, giving you one shot toward qualifying multiball for free.</p>

<h3>Character modes</h3>

<p>There are 5 characters in the game, each with a major shot assigned to them: Stan (left orbit), Chef (center lane), Kenny (the doll toy), Kyle (right ramp), and Cartman (right hole). The first time you play any character's mode, you need to hit their assigned shot 4 times to start it. The number of lit arrows on the playfield tell you how close you are to starting a mode. Each time you replay a mode, it takes one more shot to that character than it did the previous time to start that mode again. If none of the arrows pointing at a character shot are lit or flashing, you can still progress toward that mode; the lack of lights just means you're more than 4 shots away from starting it. The modes are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Stan:</i> a 4-ball quick multiball. The goal is to collect 3 kisses. You earn 1 kiss by hitting a certain number of pop bumpers or successfully making a left orbit shot. The first kiss is spotted at 12 bumpers; subsequent spotted kisses each require 4 more bumpers than the previous one did. The value of a kiss is 5,000,000 points, plus 100,000 for each bumper hit. Collecting 3 kisses counts as completing the mode, but you can continue playing and collecting kiss awards until single ball play resumes.</li>
	<li><i>Chef:</i> you have 25 seconds to shoot all 5 character shots once each. The first character shot scores 5,000,000; the second scores 6,000,000; the third scores 7,000,000; the fourth scores 8,000,000; the fifth scores 10,000,000 and completes the mode. Each character collected also adds 5 seconds to the mode's timer.</li>
	<li><i>Kenny:</i> Kenny's mode is just a single hurry-up. The hurry-up starts at 10,000,000 and counts down to 4,000,000. There is no grace period; as soon as the hurry-up hits 4,000,000, the mode ends in a failure. The hurry-up counts down quite slowly, though. Simply collect the hurry-up at any value to complete the mode.</li>
	<li><i>Kyle:</i> shoot the right ramp 4 times in 20 seconds. Shots score 5,000,000, then 10,000,000, then 15,000,000, then 20,000,000. The timer is generous, and pauses whenever the ball is on the ramp habitrail or the pop bumpers. While the ramp is probably the hardest shot in the game (tied with Stan's shot), this mode can be comboed by a good flow player since the right ramp always leads to the left flipper unless multiball is lit.</li>
	<li><i>Cartman:</i> shoot the right hole 3 times in 20 seconds. Each hole shot has a starting value of 5,000,000 that can be increased by 1,000,000 with each hit to any of the three green targets just above the hole.</li>
</ul>

<p>You cannot start a mode while another mode is running, and modes cannot be started or worked towards during multiball. The reverse is not true, though; multiball can be started during a mode. If this happens, the mode completely pauses, and resumes when the multiball ends. <br>When a mode is running, that character's head will flash on the playfield. If no mode is running, flashing character heads correspond to modes that have been played but not completed, and solidly lit character heads correspond to modes that have been completed.</p>

<p>Two wizard modes are available in the game, which somewhat follow Monster Bash rules: Spooky Vision is the mini-wizard mode you get for playing all 5 modes but not completing at least one of them, while Volcano is the full wizard mode qualified if you did complete all 5 modes. Spooky Vision and Volcano are both started at the Chef's shot, and both are 5-ball multiballs with very generous ball saves on startup.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Spooky Vision:</i> all character shots are lit for a jackpot that starts at 3,000,000 points. You can collect jackpots from the same shot repeatedly, but collecting one of each character jackpot will increase the value of all jackpots by 2,000,000 points, with no limit that I've ever encountered. I find this to be the most lucrative mode in the game, and it's not too difficult to get to. This mode lasts until the multiball ends.</li>
	<li><i>Volcano:</i> Hit any character shot a total of 15 times. Each shot scores 10,000,000 points. You receive 10,000,000 points for starting the mode, and 50,000,000 plus an extra ball if you complete it. If you complete the mode, the flippers lock up and all balls drain in celebration before you can begin the process again.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Multiball</h3>

<p>Hit the targets in front of the toilet 5 times to qualify multiball. Multiball is started at the right ramp. Additional hits to the toilet targets after multiball is ready at the right ramp (but has not been started) will increase the starting jackpot by 100,000 points each.</p>

<p>Multiball always starts with 5 balls. Jackpots are available at the toilet targets or any character shot. Character shots that correspond to modes that you've already completed score double jackpots, which are worth twice as many points but still only count as 1 jackpot earned. After making 5 jackpots, the regular jackpots unlight for 10 seconds as the right ramp is lit for super jackpot. The first super jackpot is worth 4,000,000 more than the regular jackpot, for a minimum of 5,000,000. Collecting a super jackpot increases the regular jackpot by 1,000,000, increases the super jackpot by 5,000,000, and restarts the sequence. Letting the super jackpot time out just restarts the sequence with no boosted scoring. Multiball can be worth a good amount of points, but it takes one or two super jackpots to get it on the same level as Spooky Vision or even Stan's mode. Starting multiball can be more consistent than either of those two, though.</p>

<p>When multiball is starting, the game will autoplunge 4 balls to the playfield. These autoplunges are usually done with approximately the same power as a full manual plunge, meaning they will shoot directly into the toilet targets, which score jackpots. Using this, you can skillfully drain whenever a ball save is running during multiball to get free jackpots from the toilet targets with the autoplunger.</p>

<p>Subsequent multiballs each require one more hit to the toilet targets during single ball play than the previous. The game manual implies possibility of a multiball restart option, but I've never seen this in gameplay since it's just about impossible for multiball to end without a single jackpot being collected.</p>

<h3>Townspeople and Mystery</h3>

<p>There are 5 townspeople targets in the upper left where the skill shot is lit, and three more directly above Cartman's scoop on the right. Hit a target to light the corresponding townsperson on the playfield. Light all 8 townspeople to qualify a mystery award at Chef's shot in the center lane. The mystery award will very frequently give +1 bonus multiplier, but it can also give points (5,000,000 or 7,000,000), an extra ball very rarely, or Mr Mackey's mode, where all switches in the game score 500,000 points for 30 seconds. If there are other awards, I haven't seen them.</p>

<h3>Near standup targets</h3>

<p>There are two standup targets in the lower left of the game, one on either side of the entrance to the bumpers that form Stan's shot. Both targets start at 100,000 points, with their value increasing by 100,000 per hit. After the 900,000 point hit, the 10th hit to the left target just scores 100,000 again, while the 10th hit to the right target scores 10,000,000 points- this seems like a bug. The 11th hit to either target scores 100,000 points and resets the increment sequence.</p>

<h3>Bumpers</h3>

<p>At the start of each ball, bumpers score 20,000 points per hit. Going through both in lanes activates Super Fart Bumpers, where all bumper hits score 100,000 points. Super Fart Bumpers lasts until the ball drains or until Stan's mode is played.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>South Park has a conventional in/out lane setup. Going through both in lanes activates Super Fart Bumpers as described in the previous section. Out lanes score 1,000,000 points. The right out lane can be lit for a special by completing Volcano wizard mode.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is calculated as 1,000,000 points, plus an additional 100,000 points for each hit to any character shot, any townsperson target, or the toilet. As far as I am aware of, bonus multiplier can only be increased by mystery awards. Bonus tends to be pitifully small in this game, though, rarely exceeding 5,000,000 points.</p>
