<h1 style="color:palevioletred;">Black Rose (Bally Williams, 1992)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>There are two main sources of points on Black Rose. They are not mutually exclusive, and a single game can feature both:</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Play for Double Broadside.</i> This requires opening the cannon via a soft plunge skill shot, multiple consecutive loops of the side ramp, or completing all three banks of standup targets. Then, shoot into the cannon. The first Cannon award, and every 3rd thereafter, will be Double Broadside. Shoot the Cannon at any lit shot to start the Double Broadside, then hit the Broadside scoop in the back of the game as many times as possible in 30 seconds to receive a constantly doubling award that maxes out at a repeatable 32,000,000.</li>
	<li><i>Play a really good multiball, then sink a bunch of ships.</i> Spell Lock at the in/out lanes (use lane change to help), then lock a ball at the far left Cove shot for 2-ball multiball. Relock both balls within 20 seconds of each other for 3-ball multiball. Any ramp scores 1,000,000 and one Sink Ship letter during 2-ball multiball, or 2,000,000 plus two letters during 3-ball multiball. Hit as many ramps as possible to repeatedly spell Sink Ship so that when you return to single ball play, you can repeatedly load the locker from the upper flipper than shoot the Broadside for the Sink Ship jackpot, which starts at 20,000,000 then increases by 10,000,000 for each additional ship sank.</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Skill shot</h3>

<p>Black Rose's skill shot is a precise power plunge that arcs across the playfield and hits any of the three yellow standup targets in the center of the playfield. (If you know Whirlwind's skill shot, you know how this works.) Making the skill shot scores 500,000 points and instantly opens the Cannon under the side ramp.</p>

<p>If you choose to ignore the skill shot, you have two options. Option 1 is to plunge even softer than the skill shot requires, getting the ball cleanly to the flipper and leaving open the possibility of a playfield validation ball save if you don't like the bounces and you scored no points. Option 2 is to full plunge, which (should) send the ball up the side ramp and around the back of the game, where you can use the upper flipper to repeatedly hit the side ramp and open the locker that way. I find option 2 to be the most consistent, but many competition players go for Option 1.</p>

<h3>Broadside</h3>

<p>If the white lightning bolt inserts that run directly up the center of the table are flashing in sequence, Broadside is lit. Shoot the Broadside hole in the back center of the game to earn an award. The award you get is whichever one just flashed, but it rotates so quickly that it may as well be random. The 7 awards are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Millions:</i> for 30 seconds, all ramps score Millions-Plus. The Millions-Plus value is shared between the game's three ramps, so shoot any of them to score and advance the value.</li>
	<li><i>Swing from the Riggings:</i> a video mode. You'll see a little guy swinging on a rope. Hit the Fire button on the front bar of the game with good timing (as he's moving upward and to the right) to land on the ship.</li>
	<li><i>Treasure:</i> a random odd change point value. I'm pretty sure the minimum point value is 500,000; the maximum is at least 3,500,000.</li>
	<li><i>Walk the Plank:</i> a video mode. Press the Fire button repeatedly as quickly as possible to outrun (outswim?) a shark. Make it to land to win.</li>
	<li><i>Instant Multiball:</i> starts 2-ball multiball.</li>
	<li><i>Knife Throw:</i> a video mode. Press the Fire button at the right time so that the person on the screen throws the knife into the barrel to win. I like to press the button just after he starts moving his hand down.</li>
	<li><i>Polly Says:</i> a parrot gives you a random award.</li>
</ul>
<p>All three video modes have 4 levels of increasing difficulty.<br>The three video modes and Polly Says pull their possible awards from the following list:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Points: 500,000 or 1,000,000 or 2,000,000</li>
	<li>Light Jackpot: at the left ramp</li>
	<li>Spot Letter: in Sink Ship.</li>
	<li>Open Locker: the side ramp raises up to load the Cannon.</li>
	<li>Instant Extra Ball</li>
</ul>

<p>Immediately after collecting any Broadside award, the ball is dropped on the right flipper via the center rail and a Hurry-up begins. The hurry-up starts at 2,000,000 points and counts down to 500,000 over about 10 seconds before timing out. Collect this hurry-up at the Broadside hole of the lone Doubloon standup target in the lower right of the game just below where the plunge comes out. If you fail to collect this hurry-up, shooting the Broadside hole or the Doubloon will restart the hurry-up; you must collect a hurry-up to light another Broadside award.</p>

<p>If all 7 Broadside awards are collected, the next shot to the Broadside hole lights the Jackpot on the left ramp. The jackpot is a progressive jackpot that starts at 5,000,000 points. I do not know details about what causes the jackpot to raise or by how much; I believe the maximum is 30,000,000, and I know for sure that it increases and carries over across games until collected. If you light the jackpot, there's no reason not to pick it up, but the points you get from it can be pretty easily overshadowed by other things in the game.</p>

<h3>The Locker and Double Broadside</h3>

<p>Open the locker by making a skill shot, completing all 3 banks of standup targets, looping the side ramp a few times (starts at 2 shots, but can go as high as 6), or making the 3-Bank Rebound. The 3-Bank Rebound is a trick shot where the ball hits a yellow target, then bounces into a blue target, then bounces into a red target, all on one shot, which also scores 500,000 points. The Doubloon target in the lower right spots one target in one of the banks of standups whenever it is hit.<br>Once the locker is open, use the upper flipper to shoot under the now-raised side ramp to load the Cannon.</p>

<p>When the Cannon is loaded, several shots around the table will be lit at random, which can include the Lock lane, the left and right ramps, the right orbit, the Broadside hole, or any bank of standup targets. At this point, the pinball is currently under the playfield, and the Cannon will be swiveling. Hit the Fire button when the Cannon is aligned with a lit or flashing shot and the ball will be launched in that direction. If you successfully make a shot, you will be awarded one letter in Sink Ship alongside the prize shown when the cannon was loaded. If the standup target banks are among the lit shots, a Cannon blast that bounces between more than one bank or into the Broadside hole awards one letter <i>for each of those that was hit.</i>Prizes are usually given in this sequence:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Double Broadside: a 30-second mode where the goal is to shoot the Broadside hole as many times as possible. The first shot scores 1,000,000. Each subsequent shot scores twice as much as the previous one, up to a max of 32,000,000 for shots 6 and on. My record with this is 7 shots in 30 seconds for a total of 95,000,000, but I've seen people get as many as 9 shots in the 30 seconds for 159,000,000. Outside of sinking ships, this is the best scoring round in the game.</li>
	<li>Video mode: starts one at random.</li>
	<li>Points: 5,000,000 at first, increasing by 5,000,000 every time you complete a batch of 7 cannon awards</li>
	<li>2X Sink Ship Letter: bounce between as many standup targets as possible with this cannon shot. If you ricochet between all three banks, you get a total of 6 Sink Ship letters.</li>
	<li>Instant multiball</li>
	<li>Jet Bumpers at Max: sets the pop bumper value to 15,000, and the right orbit score to 1,000,000, for the rest of the ball. (Doing this normally requires 14 right orbit shots in a single ball.)</li>
	<li>Instant Extra Ball</li>
</ul>

<p>If you load the cannon and miss, you have 20 seconds to shoot the ball back into the cannon for an Instant Reload. If you fail to reload the ball into the cannon within this time, you must go to the trouble of opening the cannon again from scratch by one of the methods listed at the top of this section.</p>

<h3>Multiball</h3>

<p>The in and out lanes have inserts that combine to spell Lock. Rolling through an unlit lane lights it. Use the lane change feature on both flippers to rotate which lanes are lit so that you aren't forced to drain to finish spelling Lock. Shooting the Pirate's Cove shot in the far left of the game when it is not lit for anything else spots you a letter in Lock. Completing the Lock letters additional times when the Lock is already lit or during multiball itself increases your bonus multiplier up to a maximum of 9x.</p>

<p>Once Lock has been spelled, shoot Pirate's Cove to lock a ball and start 2-ball multiball. During multiball, three things are available to you:</p>
<ol>
	<li><i>Shoot ramps.</i> Any flashing ramp (left, right, or side) scores 1,000,000 points and a letter in Sink Ship. These ramps also score and advance the Multiball Broadside value, which starts at 250,000, increases by 250,000 each time it is collected or the Broadside is hit during multiball, and maxes out at 4,750,000. After you finish spelling Sink Ship, keep shooting ramps to earn more letters, because you can stack multiple spellings of Sink Ship! If you do this, then when multiball ends, you'll be able to shoot the locker, sink a ship, and then immediately shoot the locker again to sink another ship. In conjunction with point 3 below, a good multiball can stack 4 or 5 spellings of Sink Ship, which will all be ready when the multiball ends.</li>
	<li><i>Shoot the flashing jewel shots. </i>These can be at the Cove, the right orbit, the side ramp, the upper loop, or any bank of standup targets. If you collect a certain number (default 6), you start Hidden Treasure for the rest of the multiball. During Hidden Treasure, all jewel shots add 350,000 to the Hidden Treasure Bonus, and all ramp shots add 500,000 to the Hidden Treasure Bonus. The Hidden Treasure Bonus is added to your score alongside the next end-of-ball bonus, and is not affected by bonus multiplier.</li>
	<li><i>Relock the 2 balls.</i> After sending one of the 2 balls back into the Pirate's Cove to relock, a 20-second timer starts. Put the second ball into the lock as well to start 3-ball multiball. If you do not relock the second ball within the 20 seconds, the first ball gets kicked back out. During 3-ball multiball, the ramp letter awards double, meaning any flashing ramp now scores 2,000,000 points and 2 Sink Ship letters on top of any Multiball Broadside or Hidden Treasure awards. This makes the ramps extremely valuable, as you can rack up Sink Ship spellings to have lots of cannon shots ready after multiball ends as described under point 1. If you start 3-ball multiball rules, the 2-letter ramps stick around until the entire multiball ends: if you drain one ball so there are only 2 on the playfield, the ramps still have their increased value, and you cannot relock balls again to put a 3rd ball back into play.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Sinking Ships</h3>

<p>Collect letters in Sink Ship by successfully making Cannon shots or multiball ramps. The game will spot 4, 3, 2, and 1 letter(s) on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th ships respectively, but after that, you're on your own for all 8 letters. Once Sink Ship is spelled, shoot into the Cannon. On a Sink Ship chance, the only scoring Cannon shot is the Broadside hole, arguably the hardest one to hit. If you do, you sink a ship and score the appropriate bonus- 20,000,000 for the first ship, and 10,000,000 more for each subsequent ship. If there is a limit on the number of ships and the award, it is at least 20 ships, with the 20th ship award being 210,000,000 points. If you miss on a Sink Ship shot, you have as much time as you like to reload the locker for another chance; you cannot take a regular Cannon shot until you have sunk all the ships that have been qualified with Sink Ship completions (which can be more than one if you played a multiball and got enough letters to complete Sink Ship more than once). Sinking Ships should be the main goal of the game, so practice shooting the Broadside with the Cannon if you ever get a chance.</p>

<p>After sinking 2 ships, a Special is lit at the Cove lock shot and the right orbit. This special is lit for 30 seconds before timing out. If it goes uncollected, it will relight with a new 30 second timer by sinking another ship.</p>

<h3>Whirlpool (right) ramp</h3>

<p>The first shot to this ramp scores 100,000 points and starts a 20 second timer. Subsequent shots score 200,000, then 300,000, then 400,000, then 1,000,000 + Extra Ball, then a flat 1,000,000, and each shot resets the timer. If the timer runs out when the ramp value is 400,000 or less, the ramp value will decrease one level and the 20 seconds starts over. If the timer runs out when the ramp value is 1,000,000, the ramp value instantly resets to its base value of 100,000. Only one extra ball can be obtained from the right ramp per ball in play. For a ramp shot to count, it must go all the way around the circular part and reach a switch in the sharp bend near the parrot in the middle-right of the game; otherwise, the shot falls off the habitrail into the pop bumpers and does not count as a Whirlpool Ramp.</p>

<h3>Right orbit</h3>

<p>At the start of each ball, pop bumpers score 1,000 per hit. Each right orbit shot increases this value by 1,000 up to a maximum of 15,000 per hit. When the bumpers are maxed out, right orbit shots score 1,000,000 points each for the rest of the ball, which is very difficult to do without the help of a Jet Bumpers at Max cannon award.</p>

<h3>Combos</h3>

<p>There is one Two way combo in the game: upper loop -> right orbit, which scores 500,000.</p>

<p>There are two Three way combos in the game: left ramp -> side ramp -> upper loop, or jet bumpers -> side ramp -> upper loop, which score 1,000,000.</p>

<p>The upper loop is the semi-hidden shot from the upper flipper above the side ramp but below the red standup targets. An upper loop shot spits the ball out of the Cove entrance on the far left.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Black Rose has a conventional in/out lane setup. There is no kickback or center post. The four in and out lanes combine to spell Lock. Roll through an unlit lane to light it, and use lane change to rotate in either direction which lanes are lit.</p>

<p>Black Rose was shipped with lightning flippers, which are flippers that are 2.875 inches long instead of the conventional 3 inches. That difference seems small, but is actually quite major; it can affect your shotmaking, how you catch the ball, and how you get control of multiple balls at once during multiball. Be mindful of this if you don't have a lot of experience with lightning flipper games.<br>The slingshot posts are quite far away from the flippers, so post transfers are much harder than usual. Most of the time, it is more consistent to use a tap pass, an alley pass, or a bailout shot of your choice to transfer the ball from one flipper to the other. Alley passes specifically can be very worthwhile on Black Rose since they get you letters toward Locks.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Standard bonus, referred to as Damage Bonus, is added to by every switch in the game and serves as an analogue of ball time. The Damage Bonus is multiplied by any bonus X award from completing the Lock lanes at the bottom of the playfield while Lock was already lit or multiball was running. Max bonus multiplier is 9x. Once those are taken care of, Hidden Treasure Bonus is added to the player's score, if applicable. None of the components of bonus or bonus multiplier can be carried over between balls, and there is no mid-ball bonus collect.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>Like many other 90s Bally Williams games, the manual suggests that specials score 1,000,000 points in competition/novelty play, but I believe this to be incorrect. I have a faint memory of being told that specials actually score 20,000,000, but this may not be true, and I have not confirmed one way or the other. There is no setting that can assign a point value to extra balls.</p>

<p>The rate at which video modes or Polly Says can give an Extra Ball or Light Jackpot is operator adjustable. By default, the Extra Ball rate is 20% and the Light Jackpot rate is 15%.</p>

<p>Every single timer mentioned throughout this guide can be set to anywhere from either 1-99 or 5-99 seconds. The values listed in this guide are the factory default settings.</p>

<p>The Skill Shot can increase in difficulty so that after being made successfully, only one or two of the yellow targets work as a skill shot instead of all three.</p>

<p>By default, Broadside is lit for free at the start of each ball. This can be changed to be off at the start of each ball or have its status carried over from ball to ball.</p>

<p>The game can be set to not start you at level 1 on each of the three video modes, and a separate setting exists to make it so that video modes never get harder after being won.</p>

<p>The default settings in multiball where any ramp can award Sink Ship letters at any time are the easy settings. On Medium settings, only the left and right ramps score Sink Ship letters. On Hard settings, only one ramp (left or right) will be lit at a time for a letter in 2-ball play, and ramps in 3-ball play still only give one letter, with the only difference being that in 3-ball rules, both ramps are lit instead of just one.</p>

<p>By default, the flipper buttons can be used to control video modes in addition to the Fire button on the front bar of the game.</p>
