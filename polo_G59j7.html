<h1>Polo / Mini Cycle (Gottlieb, 1970)</h1>

<p>Polo is the 4-player version. Mini Cycle is the otherwise identical 2 player version.</p>

<!-- end of header to copy -->

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>The preferred shot on Polo / Mini Cycle is to use the right flipper to shoot the wide-open left orbit, ideally hitting as many numbered rollover buttons along the way as possible. From the left flipper, if transferring the ball to the right flipper directly is not an option, shoot to the right side of the bumpers with the hope of a lucky bounce or nudge that puts the ball into the 500 point lane for a replunge. The vary-target and its associated value should generally be ignored.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>On the plunge</h3>

<p>If at least one of the five top lanes is lit, try to plunge that top lane for a guaranteed 100 points. If none of the top lanes are lit, as will always be the case at the start of a ball, try to short plunge into the rightmost top lane, as this gives the best chance of the ball immediately going through the 500 point lane for a replunge.</p>

<h3>1-6 numbers</h3>

<p>The 1-6 rollover buttons in a line toward the left orbit score 10 points each. If a button is lit, activating that button will unlight the button and light one top lane and one lower standup target (or, in the case of #6, the upper right standup target will be lit instead of a top lane). Lit lower standup targets score 50 points; unlit targets score 10. Lit top lanes and upper standup target score 100 points, or 10 when not lit. Collecting all of the numbers 1 through 6 scores an instant 500 points and resets the numbers, unlighting all top lanes and standup targets. Collected numbers are not preserved from ball to ball, but they are preserved if the ball goes through the 500 point lane for a replunge.</p>

<h3>Vary-target</h3>

<p>No points are awarded directly for any shot to the vary-target. The further the vary-target has been pushed in, though, the higher the value of the collect value available at the center saucer or lit out lanes. An untouched vary target has a value of 50 points; this can be increased to 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, or 1,000 points depending on how far it has been pushed in. Collecting the vary-target value in any way resets the vary-target's position. The center saucer is close enough to the flippers that a direct shot will usually be moving too fast for the ball to settle in, so a ricochet is usually required for this collect. Since hitting the vary-target alone does not guarantee a collect of its value, the risk/reward is not as lucrative as simply using the right flipper to continue to make left orbits and collect numbers and lit top lanes.</p>

<h3>Alternating features</h3>

<p>Yellow bumpers score 1 point, or 10 points when lit. The red bumper scores 10 points, or 100 points when lit. Exactly one colour of bumpers will be lit at a time; this alternates each time any player crosses any multiple of 100 points. Only one of the two out lanes is lit to score the vary-target value at a time, as well; these alternate on the same basis.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>On the left, there is no in lane, and the flipper backs up directly to the slingshot. On the right, the setup is conventional and there is an in lane. The result is that the slingshots are not horizontally aligned, and in many cases, right slingshot to left out lane drains are even more common than they are otherwise. Slingshots always score 10 points. The right in lane scores 50 points. Out lanes score 10 points or are lit alternately for the vary-target value as described above.</p>

<p>There is no end of ball bonus, extra ball feature, or playfield special. Tilt penalty is ball in play.</p>
