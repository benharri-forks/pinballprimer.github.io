<h1>Abra Ca Dabra (Gottlieb, 1975)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>To advance the "bonus" value, knock down all 10 drop targets then shoot the center bullseye target, or complete a set of 1-2-3-4. The "bonus" value is not an end of ball bonus, it is the value of hitting a lit target. Max this out at 5,000 points then hit lit drop targets. 10-point switches rotate which drops are lit and whether the 1,000 bumpers are on.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>1-2-3-4 numbers</h3>

<p>Any lane scores 500 points. Going through a lit lane unlights that number. Unlighting all of 1-2-3-4 scores and advance the current bonus value. If the bonus value is maxed at 5,000, completing 1-2-3-4 scores a special. Numbers can be collected from the top lanes and the in lanes.</p>

<h3>Drop targets</h3>

<p>Each target down scores 500 points, or the "bonus" value if that target is lit. The lights for each target are on the playfield plastic above the targets, not on the playfield itself. 10-point switch hits rotate which of the 5 targets is lit. The rubber switch behind the drop targets scores 10 points. Drop targets do not reset on their own once completed. Clearing both banks of drop targets lights the center bullseye target.</p>

<h3>Center bullseye target</h3>

<p>Scores 500 points when not lit. When lit, this target scores and advances the "bonus" value, resets both banks of drop targets, and scores a special if the bonus value was already maxed at 5,000. This target is only lit when all drop targets in both banks are down.</p>

<h3>Bumpers</h3>

<p>Score 100 points, or 1,000 when lit. 10-point switches alternate whether or not the bumpers are lit. They are always lit together rather than alternating. Hitting a lit bumper to collect the 1,000 points always unlights the bumpers.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Abra Ca Dabra has a conventional in/out lane setup, but with a second set of in lanes in place of the slingshots. The out lanes score the current bonus value. The four in lanes correspond to the 1-2-3-4 numbers and always score 500 points.</p>

<h3>Bonus?</h3>

<p>There is no end of ball bonus. The value labelled "bonus" is only awarded when hitting an out lane or lit target. The bonus value, drop target status, and progress on 1-2-3-4 lanes are all carried over from ball to ball since this is a single player game.</p>
