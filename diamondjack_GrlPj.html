<h1 style="color:red;">Diamond Jack (Gottlieb, 1967)</h1>

<p>This is the add-a-ball version. The replay version of this same layout is King of Diamonds, which will be given a separate page due to the higher than normal number of differences between the replay and add-a-ball versions of the game.</p>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Always try to plunge into the top lane of a number you don't have. The 6 and 3 targets on the far sides frequently redirect the ball into the K and Q standup targets. When the ball is in control at the bottom of the playfield, take note of whether any of the 3 most visible cards on the rotating drum have been collected yet. If not, aim for that card. If yes, then alley pass into the opposite in lane if it is lit for 100 points, or shoot up to the K and Q targets if the opposite in lane is not lit. Extra balls are awarded for finishing 2-5, 6-9, or 10-A.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Card lanes</h3>

<p>The 6, 2, 7, and 3 are at the top of the table; the 8 and 4 are in the middle on the left and right sides. All lanes score 50 points when lit (meaning the card has NOT been collected yet), or 5 points when not lit. All lanes also rotate the drum of targets in the center of the playfield, making new ones visible to be hit.</p>

<h3>A-K-Q targets and bumpers</h3>

<p>The King, Ace, and Queen targets are standups around the top of the playfield. They always score 50 points when hit. The King target also lights the left bumper; the Ace lights the center bumper; the Queen lights the right bumper. All bumpers score 1 point, or 10 points when lit. </p>

<h3>Spinning drum</h3>

<p>The drum contains each target from 2-Ace. Five of them are always visible, but only the middle 3 can be realistically shot. These targets give 5 points if the card in question has been collected already or 50 points if not, just like the lane counterparts. Any lane (top, side, in, or out) spins the drum so a new set of cards is visible. Try to get any card from the drum that you don't already have, but look especially for the 5, 9, and Ace, since those are the hardest cards to collect by other means.</p>

<h3>Jack and 10 standup targets</h3>

<p>Score 50 points each and the corresponding card. Hitting the Jack lights the left slingshot for 10 points and the left in lane for 100; the 10 target does the same on the right.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Diamond Jack has a conventional in/out lane setup. The left out lane awards the 5 card, and the right awards the 9, in the same manner as the other lanes described above. The in lanes score 50 points, or 100 when lit; they are lit by hitting the Jack or 10 target on the same side. The slingshots score 1 point, or 10 when lit, and are lit at the same time as the respective in lanes. All 4 in and out lanes also spin the center target drum. <br>It can be difficult to do with the small 2-inch flippers that this game has, but consider alley passing/shatzing the ball into the opposite in lane whenever the drum does not currently show favorable targets, especially if the opposite in lane from the one where the ball is trapped is lit for 100 points instead of 50. </p>

<h3>Add-a-ball mechanics</h3>

<p>Collecting all of 2-3-4-5 awards an extra ball, as does 6-7-8-9 and 10-J-Q-K-A. Collecting all 13 cards unlights all of them, allowing the player to begin again. To my knowledge, there is no novelty setting that replaces the extra balls with points. Up to 10 balls can be held in reserve at one time. Tilt does not end game; it disqualifies the current ball in play and subtracts one ball from the reserve. The score thresholds shown on the apron of the table also award an extra ball.</p>
