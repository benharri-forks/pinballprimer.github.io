<h1 style="text-align:center">Spin Out (1975)</h1>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p><b>If playing for points,</b> collect A-B-C-D letters as soon as possible with precise plunges and shots that go just outside the bumpers. Collected letters light various lanes around the playfield and increase the value of the roto target, center saucer, and lit lanes up to a maximum of 5,000 points each. <br><b>If playing for specials,</b> collect 1-7 numbers from the roto target or out lanes. Making any sequence of 4 in a row scores a special (wraparounds like 6-7-1-2 don't count). Collecting A-B-C-D also lights the center top lane for a special.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>A-B-C-D letters</h3>

<p>A-B-C-D letters are collected from the top lanes. Roll through a lit lane to unlight it and collect the letter. Any lane that gives a letter scores 500 points (whether lit or not) and spins the roto-target in the center of the playfield. The center top lane, between the B and C, always scores 1,000 points, or a Special when lit once all of A-B-C-D are collected. It is possible to return to the top lanes mid ball with a precise shot up either side of the table that goes just outside the bumpers and follows the curved upper walls.</p>

<p>The game's "Hole Value" is equal to 1,000 points plus an additional 1,000 for each collected A-B-C-D letter, for a maximum of 5,000 points. The Hole Value is scored whenever the ball enters the center saucer or hits either of the exposed roto-target faces. Also, each letter is tied to a lane around the game- A is the upper left side lane, B is the left in lane, C is the right in lane, and D is the upper left side lane. These lanes score 500 points and spin the roto-target if they are not lit, or they score the Hole Value + a spin if they are lit. Thus, it's ideal to get A-B-C-D letters as soon as possible, since they generally increase the value of almost everything on the table. All progress on collected letters does carry over from ball to ball.</p>

<p>If the game is set to 3 balls instead of 5, the B and C letters are tied together, so that collecting either one gives credit for both.</p>

<h3>Numbers</h3>

<p>The various faces of the roto-target in the center of the playfield contain the numbers 1-7. There are 16 possible positions that the roto-target can be in. Hitting a roto-target face lights the number on the target itself and scores the current Hole Value. Lighting any 4 numbers in sequence- 1-2-3-4, 2-3-4-5, 3-4-5-6, or 4-5-6-7- scores a Special. Wraparound sequences like 6-7-1-2 do not give a Special. Notice that the 4 is required in all four valid Special sequences; to make this harder, only one face out of the 16 on the roto-target awards the number 4. <br>The left and right out lane award both the number and the point value of the left and right roto-target faces.</p>

<p>The roto target is spun any time the ball goes through an A-B-C-D top lane (but not the Special when Lit lane in the middle), an upper side lane, an in lane, or the center saucer.</p>

<p>I believe that in a 3-ball game, the left and right faces of the roto-target are connected, so that any time either one is hit, credit for both exposed numbers is given. The Hole Value is awarded only once, though.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Spin Out has a conventional in/out lane setup. Out lanes award the current left and right roto-target value. In lanes score 500 points and a roto-spin, or the Hole Value plus a roto-spin if they have been lit by collecting the letter B (left) or C (right). Slingshots score 10 points.</p>

<h3>Bonus?</h3>

<p>There is no end-of-ball bonus in any form, nor are there any extra balls. I only know Specials to be worth a free game, though it is possible that a setting allows them to be worth points- I would expect the point value of a Special to be 5,000. Since Spin Out is one player only, all game progress (collected letters and collected numbers) always carries over from ball to ball.</p>
