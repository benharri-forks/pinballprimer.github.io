<h1 style="color:yellow;">Charlie's Angels (Gottlieb, 1978)</h1>

<p>This game has both solid-state and electromechanical versions. The guide focuses primarily on the solid state version of the game, which is much more common. Differences seen in the EM version are detailed at the bottom of the page.</p>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Complete the red targets to light the star rollovers and 2x bonus, then follow the bonus X around the playfield at lit green targets until it is maxed out at 5x. From there, focus on building bonus at the star rollovers and collecting it at the lower right standup target.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top C-H-I-C lanes</h3>

<p>Each lane scores 500 points and a bonus advance, and unlights the corresponding letter. The two Cs can be tied together, so that collecting either one gives credit for both. The H and I lanes reset the white bank of drop targets on the right side of the game; the H lane also lights those targets for a possible extra ball when the bonus count is 11,000 points or higher. Spelling C-H-I-C (on a single ball, since it resets between balls) increases the bonus multiplier and lights the in lanes alternately for a special.</p>

<h3>Red drop targets and star rollovers</h3>

<p>Each red drop target scores 500 points and advances the bonus. If the white drop target bank has been completed on this ball, each target down scores 5,000 points instead of 500. Knocking down a target also lights one of the 5 star rollovers in the upper right. Completing the red targets increases the bonus multiplier and resets the bank. If the bonus multiplier is currently 3x, the leftmost drop target in this bank is lit for advance bonus multiplier.</p>

<p>The star rollovers are the only reliable way to get back up to the top of the table for more C-H-I-C lanes. Each star rollover scores 100 points if not lit, or 1,000 points plus a bonus advance when lit. These are a great way to build the bonus back up after a mid-ball collect. Each rollover corresponds to one of the red drop targets, and lights when that target is knocked down. Even if the red bank is completed and resets, these star rollovers stay on for the rest of the ball once lit. </p>

<h3>White drop targets</h3>

<p>Each target down scores 500 points and advances the bonus. Completing the bank at any time increases the value of the red drop targets to 5,000 points each. This bank does not reset on its own once it is cleared; however, it is always reset (whether completed or not) when the ball travels through the H or I top lane. The H and I top lanes also increase the value of the white target bank to 5,000 points per drop, and the H lane only qualifies the white target to score an extra ball if it is completed while the base bonus count is 11,000 points or more. <br>If the bonus multiplier is currently 4x, the uppermost target in this 3-bank will be lit for advance bonus multiplier.</p>

<h3>Lower right standup target</h3>

<p>Scores 500 points if not lit for anything. If the current base bonus is 11,000 points or more, this target is lit yellow for a bonus collect, which scores the entire bonus including the multiplier before resetting the base bonus to 1,000 points (keeping any multipliers intact). If the bonus multiplier is currently 2x, this target is lit green for advance bonus multiplier. If the target is lit for both at once, the advance happens before the bonus collect begins.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Charlie's Angels has a mostly conventional in/out lane setup. The right in lane is at a 45 degree angle, meaning nudges may be required to access it from above and care should be taken so that a ball doesn't roll up a flipper into the out lane. Both out lanes score 5,000 points and a bonus advance. The in lanes score 500 points and a bonus advance, and they are alternately lit for a special after completing the C-H-I-C top lanes once on a ball.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Any lane (top, in, or out), any drop target, and any lit star rollover advances the base bonus. Base bonus maxes out at 19,000 points. If the base bonus is 11,000 points or more, the lower right standup target will be lit for a bonus collect, and the white drop targets will be lit for an extra ball if the H lane has been collected once that ball.</p>

<p>Completing the C-H-I-C lanes or completing the red drop targets always advances the bonus multiplier, no matter what the value is, up to the maximum of 5x. <br>If the bonus multiplier is exactly 2x, the lower right standup target will be lit for 3x bonus.<br>If the bonus multiplier is exactly 3x, the leftmost red drop target will be lit for 4x bonus. <br>If the bonus multiplier is exactly 4x, the uppermost white drop target will be lit for 5x bonus.</p>

<p>A mid-ball bonus collect is available from the lower right standup target once the base bonus count is at least 11,000 points. The bonus collect scores the entire bonus including the multiplier, before resetting the base bonus to 1,000 points and keeping the multiplier intact.</p>

<h2>Differences between the solid-state and EM versions</h2>

<ul>
	<li>In th EM game, the max bonus multiplier is 3x. The ability to advance the bonus multiplier to 3x at the lower right standup target if it is already at 2x does exist, but the ability to advance bonus X from other drop targets has been completely removed.</li>
	<li>The red drop targets do not reset on their own when completed in the EM version. Rather, the red bank resets whenever the ball goes through an in lane.</li>
	<li>The red and white drop target banks can have the value of individual targets raised on the EM game in the same way as the solid state game, but the increase value is 3,000 per target on the EM version instead of 5,000.</li>
	<li>The mid-ball bonus collect is not available. The lower right standup target now scores a bonus advance in addition to the 500 points. </li>
	<li>The out lanes score 500 points and a bonus advance on the EM game, as opposed to 5,000 and an advance in the solid state game.</li>
