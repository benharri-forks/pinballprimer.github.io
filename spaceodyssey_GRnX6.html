<h1 style="color:blue;">Space Odyssey / Space Mission (Williams, 1976)</h1>

<p>Space Odyssey is the 2 player version. Space Mission is the 4 player version. The games are otherwise identical.</p>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Advance the swinging target until a letter is lit so the side saucer light double bonus. From there, keep shooting up to the top of the playfield, aiming especially for the left spinner if it's lit or the right super bonus loop.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>The two outer lanes score 100 points, or score and advance the swinging target value when lit. The outer lanes alternate being lit with 10 point switch hits; either both are lit, or neither are.<br>The center lane scores 1,000 points, advances bonus, and can be lit for extra ball whenever the swinging target's value is 5,000 points (but not on the initial plunge).</p>

<h3>Yellow pad targets and super bonus advance</h3>

<p>The yellow targets at the top of the game score 1,000 points and a bonus advance. The red Super Bonus Advance horseshoe scores 5,000 points and 5 bonus advance. The horseshoe is at a bit of an awkward angle. It can be shot directly, but it's equally common for the ball to just kind of end up in there from a bounce off the right pop bumper. Regardless, it's very nice to end up there, and going for it is probably the best shot available from the left flipper.</p>

<h3>Swinging target</h3>

<p>A small target that swings back and forth in the middle of the playfield. Hitting it causes the light to move through the sequence on the table, which does cool things. The target always advances bonus once in addition to the lit award.</p>

<p>There are four lights labelled 5,000. From left to right, the 5,000 lights are yellow, red, green, and red. In between 5,000 lights are pairs of white 1,000 lights; each pair corresponds to A, B, or C. <br>When the light is advanced to the second insert in a letter pair, that letter is lit. (The light must be advanced to that level; it does not count if the light is already on the right B value when a ball starts, etc.) Lighting any letter turns on Lights Double Bonus at both side saucers. Lighting the letter B specifically lights the kickouts next to the flippers for 500 points instead of 50. Lighting all three of A-B-C in one ball lights the out lanes alternately for a special. <br>If the current value is any of the 5,000 lights, the left spinner will be lit for 1,000 points per spin, and the top center lane will be lit for extra ball. Lit spinner shots are almost certainly the best source of scoring in this game. Unfortunately, since lighting the spinner is tied to the swinging target's award and since the ball can't really be trapped up for a nice aimed shot, it's not the easiest to pull off. A good lit spinner shot can award 20,000 points or more, though. If the ball is drained when the spinner and extra ball are lit, the spinner will stay on for the next ball/player but the extra ball will unlight until the swinging target value is advanced to a different 5,000 light. <br>The swinging target value stays where it is from player to player.</p>

<h3>Spinner</h3>

<p>Scores 100 points per spin when not lit. See previous section for how to light it. The lane with the spinner leads back to the top of the playfield and has a bonus advance switch along the way.</p>

<h3>Side saucers</h3>

<p>Kick the ball out towards the flipper on the same side of the table. They score 50 points normally. Lighting any A-B-C letter lights both saucers for 500 points and double bonus. Be sure not to miss out on the double bonus.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Space Mission has no in lanes. The out lanes score 1,000 points, and can be lit for a special when all of A-B-C has been lit.</p>

<p>In place of regular slingshots, this game has kickout holes just above either flipper. They score 50 points (or 500 when lit by collecting the letter B) and fire the ball toward the swinging target. The ball cannot be trapped on the flippers: holding up the flippers will just cause the ball to roll back into the kickout. This means that it's more difficult to get the ball under control to take a shot at the spinner or super bonus lane, but it's not always a bad thing, because sometimes just by holding the flippers up this machine can play itself for a little while, kicking the ball out of one side, off the swinging target, and then falling into the other kickout with the help of a raised flipper. If your local Space Mission has particularly strong kickouts, it's possible a ball could bounce directly off the swinging target and into the out lane, but unlikely. Continue to watch the ball carefully though and be on alert if the kickout hits the side of the swinging target and changes the ball's momentum.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is advanced at the center top lane, the yellow standup targets, the swinging target, the spinner lane, and 5 times by the super bonus horseshoe lane. Max bonus is 20,000 points. Bonus cannot be held over from ball to ball.<br>Bonus can be doubled by lighting any A-B-C letter and then shooting a lit side saucer. There is no multiplier past double. Double bonus cannot be held from ball to ball, but can be lit on any ball. Double bonus is not given for free on the final ball of the game. Max bonus is 2x 20,000 = 40,000 points. (This is very significant so don't forget to pick up your double bonus!)</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>Bonus advances from anywhere on the table can be set to award 100 points each instead of 1,000.
<br>The super bonus advance horseshoe can be set to award 3 bonus advance instead of 5.
<br>The lit spinner and lit extra ball can be made even more rare by setting them to light only when the swinging target award is red or yellow, and not green; or they can be set to light when the swinging target award is only red, not yellow or green.
<br>Special can be set to score a free game or an extra ball. Special and extra ball cannot be set to be worth points.</p>
