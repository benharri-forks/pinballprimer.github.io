<h1>Blue Note / Rock Star (Gottlieb, 1978)</h1>

<p>Blue Note is the replay version. Rock Star is the add-a-ball version. Differences between the two are explained throughout the guide.</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Hit as many 5,000-point left standup targets as possible. On Blue Note, targets are worth 5,000 when NOT lit, so hit all but one of the targets and whale on whichever ones are unlit. On Rock Star, targets are worth 5,000 when they ARE lit, so complete sets of the targets to earn extra balls and relight them. If the ball is on the left flipper and the center spinner value is currently 1,000 points, shoot that unless you can backhand a 5,000 point target.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Skill shot and top lanes</h3>

<p>At the beginning of the ball, one of the three top lanes will randomly be lit green for 10,000 points. The green lit lane may or may not correspond to a letter in A-B-C that you already have. The 10,000 point lane will unlight itself as soon as any other switch in the game is registered.</p>

<p>Top lanes score 500 points. Rolling through a lane lit for A, B, or C collects that letter and unlights that lane. Collecting B lights the right in lane for 1,000 points instead of 100. Completing A-B-C lights the upper right star rollover for 1,000 points instead of 500, and also lights the lower right saucer for extra ball. The lit extra ball stays on until collected; other A-B-C awards stay lit for the whole game. A-B-C never resets.</p>

<h3>Solfege (left standup) targets</h3>

<p>Targets start lit. Hit a llit target to unlight it. On Blue Note, lit targets score 500 points and unlit targets score 5,000, so unlight a target that is safe to shoot at and whale on it. On Rock Star, lit targets score 5,000 points and unlit targets score 500, so focus on trying to complete a set. After hitting all 8 targets, one target will be lit for Special (Blue Note) or Wow (Rock Star), rotating whenever a slingshot or bumper is hit. Collecting the Special or Wow relights all 8 targets, resetting the sequence.<br>(Wow on Rock Star is worth either 1 extra ball or 50,000 points.)</p>

<h3>Bumpers</h3>

<p>In 3-ball play, the center purple bumper scores 1,000 points and all other bumpers score 100. In 5-ball play, the center purple bumper scores 100 points and all other bumpers score 10.</p>

<h3>Spinners</h3>

<p>The right spinner always scores 10 points per spin. Each spin rotates the value of the center spinner between 10, 100, or 1,000 points. The center spinner scores the lit value per spin. A 1,000 point center spinner can be good value, but because there are dangerous bumpers directly behind the spinner, it's not worth passing up on a 5,000 point left standup target to shoot the spinner.</p>

<h3>Right saucer</h3>

<p>Always scores 5,000 points, and is also lit for Extra Ball (Blue Note) or Wow (Rock Star) once A-B-C is completed in the game.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>On the left side, there is no in or out lane, and the left flipper backs up directly to the left slingshot. The right side of the table bottom is conventional, with a single flipper, slingshot, in lane, and out lane. The two flippers are not centered horizontally, nor are they even vertically; the left flipper is slightly lower on the playfield than the right, making flipper skill moves and saves deceptively difficult.</p>

<p>There is no end of ball bonus.</p>
