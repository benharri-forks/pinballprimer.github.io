<h1 style="color:blue;">Rack-a-Ball (Gottlieb, 1962) / Bowling Queen (Gottlieb, 1964) / Mibs (Gottlieb, 1969)</h1>

<p>These three tables share the same layout. Rules and scoring are identical between Rack-a-Ball and Bowling Queen, with only minor changes made for Mibs that are mentioned at the end of the guide.</p>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Aim for the standup targets that light the bumpers or slingshots, then shoot the ball into the bumper area repeatedly and use nudging to go through lit lanes where possible.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Lit lanes</h3>

<p>There are 12 in total: two in the top center, two in the upper left, two in the upper right, one in the middle left, one in the middle right, and two in the out lanes on each side. Going through a lit lane scores 50 points and adds a bowling ball to the rack on the backbox. Going through an unlit lane scores 5 points. Replays can be scored by making certain thresholds of conventional points or by making a certain number of lit lanes: typically, replays are awarded at 9, 10, and 11 bowling balls collected.</p>

<h3>Standup targets and bumpers</h3>

<p>All bumpers score 1 point, or 10 points when lit. Blue bumpers are lit by the 50 point blue standup target in the lower left of the playfield; red bumpers are lit by the 50 point red standup in the lower right. Each activation of a 1-point switch alternates whether the red or blue bumpers are lit.</p>

<p>In the upper middle of the playfield is a white 50-point Lights Kickers standup target that lights the slingshots at the bottom of the table for 10 points each. The slingshots are always on once this target has been hit; they do not alternate in any way like how the bumpers do.</p>

<p>Hitting all three standup targets at any point over the course of the game causes one of the four outlanes to light for a special. The lit lane rotates with each 1-point switch hit.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>There are no in lanes. The flippers back up directly to the slingshots. The flipper gap is very wide, but there is a larger than average center peg between the flippers to help save center drains. <br>Rather than conventional triangle shaped slingshots, this game has thin rail slings that leave space for two outlanes underneath them on each side. These lanes are lit for a bowling ball at the start of the game just like all other lanes, scoring 50 points when lit and 5 points if not, and they are lit for a special after hitting all three standup targets in a game as described above.</p>

<h3>Scoring changes made in Mibs (1969)</h3>

<p>Rack-a-Ball and Bowling Queen have identical scoring. Mibs makes the following changes only:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Lit lanes score 500 points instead of 50.</li>
	<li>Unlit lanes score 50 points instead of 5.</li>
	<li>The standup targets that light the bumpers or slingshots score 100 points instead of 50.</li>
</ul>
<p>General strategy remains the same, with significantly more emphasis on being able to nudge your way into lit lanes on Mibs whenever possible compared to the two earlier versions of the playfield.</p>
