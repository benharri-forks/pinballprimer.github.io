<h1 style="color:tan;">OXO (Williams, 1973)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Try to complete a tic tac toe to light the saucers for extra ball and 5,000 points. If you cat game yourself, try to get a symbol in every box to light the side lanes for special, which can also give extra ball. Hitting A and B opens the right gate for a replunge, which is pretty much the only way to get more than one top lane on a ball.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>There are six. Each set of two corresponds to one of the top row of tic tac toe boxes, and each lane within the set will always light that box with the labelled symbol. It's unnecessary, and in fact redundant, to get all 6 lanes, since once a tic tac toe box is filled, its symbol cannot be changed for the rest of the ball.</p>

<h3>Bumpers</h3>

<p>There are three. The two blue ones score 10 points or 100 when lit, the green one scores 100 points or 1,000 when lit. The blue ones always alternate whether the lit symbol is an X or an O, whether lit or not. The blue bumpers light when a tic-tac-toe has been completed. The green bumper lights upon completion of A-B.</p>

<h3>A-B</h3>

<p>Standup targets above and slightly to the side of the bumpers. Each scores 100 points. Making A+B lights the green bumper for 1,000 points and opens the right side gate.</p>

<h3>Side lanes</h3>

<p>Score 1,000 points and fill in the middle-left or middle-right boxes with the currently lit symbol as indicated. If all 9 boxes have been filled in on this ball, these lanes light for special. Special can be set to score a free game or extra ball, but has no point value.</p>

<h3>Center target</h3>

<p>Scores 100 points and lights the center tic-tac-toe box with the currently lit symbol. This target can be dangerous to hit and cause center drains, so be careful.</p>

<h3>Side saucers</h3>

<p>Score 500 points normally. If a tic-tac-toe has successfully been completed on this ball, the saucers will be lit for 5,000 points plus extra ball. Collecting this award unlights the saucers to be worth 500 points again.

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>OXO has a conventional in lane/out lane setup. Out lanes always score 1,000 points. In lanes always score 100 points and light one of the bottom corners of the tic-tac-toe board with the currently lit symbol. Between and just above the flippers is a rollover button that fills in the bottom middle square of the board. <br>Alley passing is very powerful on OXO because the in lane guide rail is curved, making it so that the bottom row of the tic-tac-toe board- filled in by the in lanes and the rollover very close to the flippers- are the three easiest boxes to light. A tic-tac-toe can be earned quite easily by focusing only on these three boxes and not worrying about a center drain off the middle target or shooting to the top of the playfield and changing the lit symbol with a bumper. </p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>The end of ball bonus is simply 1,000 points for each box that was filled in during that ball, for a maximum of 9,000 points. On the final ball of the game, bonus is tripled, to a maximum of 27,000 points. There is no other way to light/earn the triple bonus. This makes it considerably more important to get extra balls on ball 5 to be able to use that triple bonus more than once in a game (if extra balls are on at all, that is).</p>
