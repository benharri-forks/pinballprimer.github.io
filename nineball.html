<h1 style="color:navy;">Nine Ball (Stern Electronics, 1980)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Hit lit numbered drop targets on the left to advance through the rank up to 9 ball, which lights Wow (extra ball). Completing 3-banks advances bonus multiplier. Blue drop targets from within the 3-banks advance the spinner value, but it unlights after one rip. In the top left, go around the horseshoe to increase the red drop target's value, then collect and reset the value at the target itself.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>1-9 numbers</h3>

<p>The goal is pretty much always to hit the flashing targets. At first, the 1-9 balls must be collected in order by hitting those drop targets. When a correct ball is collected, all 8 drop targets will reset and then the one corresponding to collected balls will be automatically lowered, to get rid of any targets collected out of order. Finish 1-8 to qualify the 9 ball.<br>For the 9 ball, all targets will re-raise, and one of the numbered targets will flash. The flashing light will move down the bank every couple seconds. Hit the flashing drop target to collect the 9 ball. <br>After the 9 ball is collected, the Wow and the Special are in play. The Wow lights immediately after the 9 ball and works the same way: hit the flashing target. This time, though, pay attention to the second column of lights next to the drop targets (the blue ones, rather than the multicolour ones). Collecting the 9 ball and then completing all eight drop targets again lights the special, which also rotates between the drops, but <i>this</i> indicator light is the right hand column of red lights. Notice that the special cannot move to the 1 target, it only rotates between the other 7.</p>

<p>Collecting the 5 ball lights the upper left lane for a lock. Collecting the 9 ball enables this lane to lock multiple balls, and means the player's next ball will have a 77,000 point super bonus added to the end of ball bonus.</p>

<p>The Wow can be set to light up and start moving after the 8 ball is collected instead of the 9. It is then possible to hit a drop target that is lit for both the Wow and 9 ball. In this case, the Wow takes precedence, and the 9 ball is not awarded. It is similarly possible for a target to be lit for both a Special and a Wow at the same time, in which case the special takes priority and the Wow is not scored.</p>

<p>1-9 balls can also be spotted by:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the upper right "spot # target when lit" passive bumper when it is lit (can only spot 1-7, not 8 or 9)</li>
	<li>lit in lanes (can only spot 1-7, not 8 or 9)</li>
	<li>the lock shot, regardless of whether lock is lit or not</li>
</ul>
<p>The upper right passive bumper and the in lanes are lit some of the time, toggled by slingshot and bumper hits. Exactly how often they are on is a setting within the game. They will never light up after the 7 ball has been collected.</p>

<h3>Lock lane (left side) and multiball</h3>

<p>This lane is impossible to shoot directly due to the angle of the entrance, so you need to rely on a ricochet off of the geometry of the top of the game, most likely the solo pop bumper. Making it into this lane can spot any of the 1-8 balls for you, but not the 9. If the 5 has not been collected, a ball in this lane will kick out downwards towards the flippers. If the 5 ball has been collected, one pinball that ends up here will be locked for multiball, but if a second ball enters this lane, one of them will be kicked out downwards. If the 8 ball has been collected, the lock lane becomes eligible to capture more than one ball.<br>Collecting the 9 ball, or locking three balls in the lane, releases any and all locked balls for multiball.</p>

<p>Multiball in Nine Ball is not particularly valuable. There is no playfield multiplier or unique scoring features, and the multiple balls in play make it a little more difficult to intentionally set up some of the high value scoring in the game like the top left horseshoe lane and the lit spinner. There is lock stealing in this game, since locked balls do not eject until the end of the game or until they are released with a proper start to multiball, but this rarely comes up due to how difficult it is to start a multiball in the first place. </p>

<h3>Upper left horseshoe and target</h3>

<p>The horseshoe shot in the far upper left of the game scores 3,000 points and advances the value of the large red target between the exits of the horseshoe. The value is advanced in the order of 10,000 - 20,000 - 30,000 - 40,000 - 173,000. (No, that's not a mistake. Your guess is as good as mine.) Advancing the value again when 173,000 is lit resets the value back to 10,000. The target value is scored by simply hitting the big red target, and this also resets the target value back to 10,000.</p>

<h3>Upper right drop target banks</h3>

<p>Drop targets score 1,000 points each. Each blue target advances the spinner value. The red targets can be lit for 7,000 instead of 1,000; which one is lit alternates with slingshot or pop bumper hits. Completing either bank of drop targets advances the bonus multiplier. If the bonus multiplier is maxed out at 7x, a Wow will rotate between the four blue targets across the two banks. </p>

<h3>Right spinner</h3>

<p>Scores 100 points per spin when not lit. Blue drop targets advance the spinner value, to 400 - 900 - 1,600 - 2,500 per spin. The lit value only lasts for one rip; once the spinner registers, it will unlight after about 1 second if a further spin is not scored. The spinner value can be instantly maxed out at 2,500 a spin by hitting the semi-obscured standup target in the top right of the game, just below the wall that a full-plunged ball will hit.</p>

<p>The pop bumper scores 100 points or the lit spinner value.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Nine Ball has a conventional in/out lane setup with a center peg between the flippers. The out lanes score 3,000 points and are lit alternately throughout the ball for Collect Loop Target Value, meaning it's possible for an out lane to actually be a 176,000 point drain. The in lanes are lit occasionally for Spot Number until the 7 has been collected. Slingshots and pop bumper hits rotate whether/which in lanes are lit.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus simply consists of 1,000 points for each of the 9 balls collected, times the bonus multiplier. Bonus multiplier does carry over from ball to ball, unless it is advanced to 6x or 7x, in which case it will reset back to 2x on the next ball. If the previous ball (the ball <i>before</i> the one that just drained) collected the 9 ball, a 77,000 point super bonus will be added. Max bonus is 77,000 + (7x 9,000) = 140,000 points.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>There are 8 possible settings for the value of the special and Wow awards:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Special awards replay, Wow awards extra ball</li>
	<li>Special awards replay, Wow awards 70,000 points</li>
	<li>Special awards extra ball, Wow awards 70,000 points</li>
	<li>Special awards extra ball, Wow awards 40,000 points</li>
	<li>Special awards 130,000 points, Wow awards extra ball</li>
	<li>Special awards 130,000 points, Wow awards 70,000 points</li>
	<li>Special awards 90,000 points, Wow awards extra ball</li>
	<li>Special awards nothing, Wow awards 40,000 points</li>
</ul>

<p>Bonus multiplier can be set to only advance when both 3-banks of targets have been completed, instead of just one. Regardless of this setting, the 3-banks will not reset until both are completed.</p>

<p>The Wow that rotates between the left drop targets and the 77,000 super bonus can be set to be qualified by collecting the 8 ball instead of the 9 ball.</p>

<p>The bonus multiplier threshold at which the rotating Wow on the upper right drop targets lights can be set to 6x instead of 7x.</p>
