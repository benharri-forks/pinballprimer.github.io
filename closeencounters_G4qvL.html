<h1 style="color:orange;">Close Encounters of the Third Kind (Gottlieb, 1978)</h1>

<p>This game has both SS and EM versions. The guide focuses primarily on the much-more-common solid state version. Differences in the EM version are discussed at the end of the guide.</p>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Use the right flipper to shoot the lower left standup target to light the spinner, then the spinner itself. Use the left flipper to hit drop targets or the roto-wheel if the star is showing to advance bonus multipliers. Collecting A-B-C letters lights different panels of the roto-wheel and specific drop targets for additional value.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes and A-B-C</h3>

<p>Each top lane scores 5,000 points, advances the bonus, and spins the roto-wheel. Going through a lane with a lit A-B-C letter unlights that lane and collects the letter. The A lights the left panel of the roto-wheel for 10x value and the topmost drop target for 5,000 points. The B does the same to the center roto-wheel panel and the center drop target; the C does the same to the right panel of the roto-wheel and the bottommost drop target. Completing A-B-C lights the left panel of the wheel for an extra ball and the right panel of the wheel for a special, but only if the star is showing in that position.</p>

<h3>Roto-wheel</h3>

<p>Possible panels of the roto-wheel are 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, or the star. Hitting a panel scores the corresponding value, or 10x the value if that panel has been lit up by collecting the corresponding A-B-C letter. The star awards a base value of 500 points, and increases the bonus multiplier. The star can also award an extra ball or a special if it is in the left or right side position and that award has been lit after completing all three of A-B-C. </p>

<h3>Bullseye standup targets</h3>

<p>Positioned to the left of the bumpers, just below and to the left of the A top lane. Lit targets score 2,000 points and 2 bonus advances, while unlit targets score 1,000 points and 1 advance. Every other switch hit over the course of the game alternates which one of the two targets is lit.</p>

<h3>Right drop targets</h3>

<p>Each target down scores 500 points and a bonus advance, unless it is one of the yellow targets that has been lit for 5,000 points by collecting the corresponding letter in A-B-C. Completing the bank scores an additional 5,000 points, adds 5 bonus advance, and increases the bonus multiplier. </p>

<h3>Left spinner</h3>

<p>Scores 100 per spin, or 1,000 when lit. It is lit for the remainder of the ball by hitting the lower left standup target just below it. Lighting and then ripping the spinner is the only thing that should be attempted with the right flipper.</p>

<h3>Lower left standup target</h3>

<p>Scores 500 points and 1 bonus advance, lights the spinner, and spins the roto-wheel.</p>

<h3>Lower right side lane</h3>

<p>Scores 500 points and a bonus advance, and spins the roto-wheel. Balls coming out of the bottom of this lane are supposed to be gently funneled into the right in lane, but can frequently hit off the top of the right slingshot just hard enough that it takes some effort to prevent them from going down the out lane.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Close Encounters has a conventional in/out lane setup. In lanes score 500 points, 1 bonus advance, and a spin of the roto-wheel. The left and right out lanes score the value of the roto-wheel panel currently in the left-hand or right-hand position, including any score multipliers, bonus multipliers, or (I believe) the extra ball or special.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is advanced by the top lanes, right side lane, in lanes, and any standup or drop target. Bonus is advanced 2 times by the lit upper left standup target, and 5 times for completing the drop target bank. Maximum base bonus is 20,000 points.<br>Bonus multiplier is advanced by hitting the star panel of the roto-wheel at any time, or by completing the drop target bank. Maximum bonus multilpier is 5x. <br>Base bonus value and bonus multiplier can never be carried from ball to ball.</p>

<h3>Differences between the solid-state and electro-mechanical versions</h3>

<p>On the EM version:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Maximum bonus multiplier is 3x instead of 5x.</li>
	<li>The score display is 5 digits with a 100,000 light, instead of 6 full digits.</li>
	<li>Top lanes only score 5,000 when lit; they score 500 when not lit. The top lanes always score 5,000 on the solid state version.</li>
	<li>The upper left bullseye standup targets score 100 when not lit or 500 plus a bonus advance when lit, instead of 1,000 + 1 advance when not lit and 2,000 + 2 advance when lit.</li>
	<li>Pop bumpers score 1,000 points in 3-ball play, but only 100 in 5-ball play. They always score 1,000 on the solid state version.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other notes</h3>

<p>In the solid state version, completing A-B-C lights both the extra ball and the special at the roto-wheel on 3-ball play, but on 5-ball play, A-B-C only lights the extra ball, and the drop targets must also be completed to light the roto-wheel special.</p>
