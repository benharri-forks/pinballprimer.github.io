<h1 style="color:blue;">Cosmic Princess (Allied Industries / Stern Electronics, 1979)</h1>

<p>Not to be confused with Cosmic Gunfight (Williams, 1982).</p>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Try to make the #3 top lane on the opening plunge. If your game is set so that specials score 100,000 points, go only for completions of the drop targets. Otherwise, split your focus between the drop targets for bonus multipliers and the spinners; the left spinner/orbit takes you back to the top to collect more numbers and increase the spinner values, while the right spinner gives you a chance at a full bonus collect.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>Numbered 1 to 5. Going through any lane scores 1,000 points and a bonus advance, and lights that number. Lighting numbers is how you increase the value of the spinners, discussed in more detail later. The 2 and 4 can be collected from standup targets in the lower corners of the playfield, and the 1 and 5 can be collected from the left orbit rollovers, so getting the 3 as soon as possible (ideally off the plunge) is preferred. Completing 1-5 once lights the near left in lane for an extra ball and resets the 1-5 lights (though the spinners keep their value). Completing 1-5 twice in a single ball scores a special.</p>

<h3>Bumpers</h3>

<p>The uppermost bumper always scores 1,000 points and a bonus advance. The other two bumpers score 1,000 points in a 3-ball game or 100 in a 5-ball game, and do not advance bonus.</p>

<h3>Drop targets</h3>

<p>Any target down scores 500 points.<br>For the first set, only the second and fourth targets will be up. Clearing both scores 5,000 points and 2x bonus.<br>For the second set, only the first, third, and fifth targets are up. Clear all 3 for 10,000 points, 3x bonus, and the near right in lane being lit for Special. <br>For the third set, all targets except the middle will be up. Clear all 4 for 20,000 points and 4x bonus.<br>For the fourth set, all 5 targets must be cleared. Do so for 30,000 points and 5x bonus.<br>Any completions after the 4th on a single ball require hitting all 5 targets and score an instant special.</p>

<h3>Collect bonus saucer</h3>

<p>The saucer cannot be shot directly, but the ball frequently ends up there off the pop bumpers from a right spinner shot. This saucer scores a full collect of the entire bonus with multiplier. After the collect, the base bonus will be reset to 1,000, but any collected multipliers remain intact.</p>

<h3>Spinners and left orbit</h3>

<p>The spinners score 200 points per spin by default. Each of the 1 and 2 add 400 points per spin to the left spinner's value if they have been collected this ball; the 4 and 5 do the same to the right spinner value. Collecting the 3 lights one of the spinners pink, alternating on pop bumper and 10-point switch hits; the lit pink spinner is worth an extra 1,000 per spin. Thus, after all 5 numbers have been collected once on a ball, there will always be one spinner worth 1,000 per spin, and the other worth 2,000 per spin. If specials are not set to be worth points, a 2,000 point spinner is the best value shot in the game.</p>

<p>Behind the left spinner are three star rollovers. Two of these spot the numbers 1 and 5, while the star in the middle increases the point value of the far in lanes, discussed in more detail in the Bottom of the table section.</p>

<h3>Side standup targets</h3>

<p>The one on the left spots #2, and the one on the right spots #4. Both score 1,000 points and a bonus advance.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Cosmic Princess has a nearly conventional in/out lane setup, with a second set of in lanes closer to the flippers in place of a standard slingshot. <br>Out lanes always score 5,000 points and 3 bonus advance. <br>The far in lanes start out scoring 2,000 points. The star rollover directly above the flippers and the middle star rollover in the left orbit advance these lanes, adding 2,000 to their value, up to a maximum of 8,000 points. <br>The left near in lane scores 5,000 points and 3 bonus advance, and is lit for extra ball after completing the set of 1-2-3-4-5. The right near in lane scores 5,000 points and can be lit for a Special by achieving 3x bonus.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Base bonus is advanced by any top lane, any standup target, the Spot 1 and Spot 5 rollovers in the left orbit, and the uppermost pop bumper. Base bonus is advanced 3 times by the out lanes or the near in lanes. Max base bonus is 19,000 points. Bonus multiplier is advanced one step with each completion of the drop target bank, up to a maximum of 5x. Max bonus, then, is 5x 19,000 = 95,000 points. Neither base bonus nor bonus multiplier can ever be carried from ball to ball. The upper right saucer is always available as a mid-ball bonus collect; this is a full collect including the multiplier, and after the collect, your base bonus will be reset to 1,000 but all multipliers stay intact.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>In competition/novelty play, specials score 100,000 points. If this setting is on and specials are open ended (see below), it may be worthwhile to ignore the spinners and continue clearing drop targets to collect 100,000s. There is no setting that allows setting a point value to extra balls.</p>

<p>The drop target special and the in lane special can each individually be set to a limit of 1 per ball or "open ended" (infinite available).</p>

<p>The extra ball and special on the in lanes can be set to alternate on pop bumper hits instead of always being on once lit.</p>
