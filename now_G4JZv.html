<h1>Now (Gottlieb, 1971)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Try to plunge whichever top lane is lit for 300 points. Determine how controllable and safe the lower left and lower right kickbacks are. If they are safe, complete the red and white drop target banks, then attempt to score the red and white bonuses from the lower kickbacks or upper side lanes. If that is not possible, just try to hit 300 points standup targets in the lower part of the playfield and/or aim for replunges from the right side return lane.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>One is lit for 300 points. The other three lanes score 50 points. Each time the 100 point relay is triggered during the game, the light will rotate one lane. </p>

<h3>Upper left and upper right standups</h3>

<p>Score 50 points, or 300 when lit. One of these two will always be lit, alternating with every 100 points scored.</p>

<h3>Pop bumpers</h3>

<p>All three bumpers score 1 point, or 10 points when lit. Every 100 points scored alternates whether the two green bumpers or the one blue bumper will be lit.</p>

<h3>Tops of the triangles</h3>

<p>Score 1 point each, but are just rubbers with switches behind them, not slingshots.</p>

<h3>Upper/middle side lanes</h3>

<p>Score 100 points plus the corresponding colour bonus when lit. Red and white bonuses are simply equal to 100 points for each red or white drop target currently down. Collecting either bonus will reset the drop targets of that colour.<br>A ball coming through the white bonus lane on the right can frequently be nudged back into the replunge.</p>

<h3>Red and white drop targets</h3>

<p>Two 4-banks of drop targets. Red is on the left, white is on the right. Each target down scores 100 points. The red bonus and white bonus, when collected, score 100 points for each target down, and is the only way to reset these target banks (other than draining the ball). </p>

<h3>Replunge</h3>

<p>A ball coming through the upper collect white bonus lane, or a ball shot at the rightmost white drop target from the left flipper, may end up going through a small passageway that leads back to the shooter lane for another plunge, just as if a new ball was starting. </p>

<h3>Lower standup targets</h3>

<p>There are two on each side. One of the targets in each pair will be lit for 300 points, the other will score 50. Each activation of the 100 point relay alternates which target in each pair is lit.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>The flippers are in the conventional position. There are no in lanes. The flippers back directly up to a very small triangular shaped rubber, which is not even actually a slingshot. Just outside the triangle rubber are out lanes that score the red bonus (on the left) and white bonus (on the right). Just outside of those, and obscured by the plastics, are kickback lanes that also score the red and white bonuses on the left and right respectively. These lanes fling the ball into the drop targets on their side, and from there the ball usually is able to be trapped on or dead bounced off of the flipper on the same side as the kickback that was just used. Collecting the red or white bonus resets the respective drop targets; the kickback will usually then collect one of the newly raised drop targets for you for free, unless the kickbacks are very weak.</p>

<h3>Settings</h3>

<p>I have been unable to confirm this for certain, but the phrasing of "red/white bonus when lit" on the table at the side lanes, out lanes, and kickback lanes implies that there is a setting within the game where only one of the coloured bonuses will be lit at a time, perhaps alternating with 100 point switches like most other things in the game. If you encounter this on a copy of Now, email aquaticespeon@gmail.com or message solar_espeon on Discord or Twitter and let me know.</p>
