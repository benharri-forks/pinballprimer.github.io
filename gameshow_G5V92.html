<h1 style="color:red;">The Bally Game Show (Bally Williams, 1990)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>When the ball is on a flipper, shoot for the top loop if it is lit for Spot Letter on the entrance opposite where the ball is. If not, shoot for the center ramp from the left flipper, or shoot for the Car drop target/Big Bucks hole in the top left from the right flipper. Light a prize by spelling it, then shoot the right ramp to collect it. Collect all 4 prizes to start multiball- the only different thing to do in multiball is shoot the right ramp immediately to collect the lone jackpot.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top $ lanes</h3>

<p>On any plunge, shoot the flashing lane for an instant bonus multiplier advance. Otherwise, light all 3 lanes to advance the bonus multiplier. Lit lanes can be moved via lane change, but the flashing skill shot lane cannot. Both flippers can be used for the lane change, but they both rotate the lanes in the same direction.</p>

<h3>Prizes and right ramp</h3>

<p>Spell a prize by hitting all of its targets to light it. The TV is spelled at the red targets just left of the center ramp; the Trip is at the 4 blue targets on the far right; the Truck is at the 5 green targets on the far left; and the Car is the single drop target in the back left of the game. Completing a prize lights it at the right ramp, and lights the right ramp for Collect. <br>To squeeze the most points out of how this works, collect the Car first, then be sure to make the right ramp after each prize is lit, so that the Car value is collected all 4 times. The Car scores 200,000 points, the Truck scores 100,000, the Trip scores 50,000, and the TV scores 25,000. Making the right ramp after collecting all 4 prizes locks a ball, and the next ball plunged starts multiball. </p>

<p>During multiball, the first and only order of business is to shoot the right ramp as quickly as possible. The right ramp holds the Showcase Bonanza Grand Prize: this jackpot is worth 3,000,000 for 5 seconds at the start of multiball, then loses 100,000 per second, until bottoming out at 1,000,000 and staying there until collected. There is a 5-second grace period on the Grand Prize if it is not collected before one of the two balls drains. There are no other multiball-specific features; everything is in play, with the ability to collect the prizes again with 2 balls in play. </p>

<h3>Big Bucks</h3>

<p>The Big Bucks hole is directly behind the Car drop target. Making Big Bucks the first time on a ball scores 100,100 points. Each subsequent Big Bucks collect scores 100,100 more than the last, up to a maximum of 900,900. After every 2 Big Bucks collects, the Car drop target will re-raise, making it just a little harder to combo this shot repeatedly. The hole itself brings the ball back to the right flipper. The Big Bucks value resets at the end of each ball.</p>

<h3>Upper loop</h3>

<p>The upper loop goes around the pop bumpers. The left entrance is in the far upper left of the game, and the right entrance is between the center and right ramps. One of the two entrances will always be lit for Spot Letter; which entrance is lit alternates with each pop bumper hit. Making the loop through the lit entrance awards a letter in the lowest value prize that has not yet been collected: TV, then Trip, then Truck, then Car. (The Car can be given with a single spot, since it just requires one target.) <br>A weak loop shot puts the ball in the $ top lanes; a strong right loop shot brings the ball down the left orbit, and a strong left loop shot puts the ball in the pop bumpers. The spinner near the right entrance scores 1,000 points per spin, or it can be briefly lit for 3,000/spin by going through the left in lane. The left loop entrance is lit for an extra ball by the corresponding Wheel award. Both entrances to the loop are very briefly lit for 2,000,000 points after collecting the "Light 4 Million" Wheel award as well.</p>

<h3>Center ramp and Big Wheel</h3>

<p>At the beginning of each ball, and whenever the Wheel is lit for Spin, the wheel in the center of the playfield spins and lands on a random number between 5,000 and 50,000. After a successful spin, the ramp is lit for Nudge, which advances the wheel one position for the purpose of collecting awards. Landing on a wedge scores that wedge's value; also, hitting any letter target in the game toward a prize scores 10,000 points plus the lit wheel value.</p>

<p>The Wheel values that are not multiples of 10,000 also have secondary awards:</p>
<ul>
	<li>5,000 also has Lite Extra Ball</li>
	<li>15,000 also has Instant 250,000</li>
	<li>25,000 also has Hold Bonus</li>
	<li>35,000 also has Instant 1 Million</li>
	<li>45,000 also has Lite 4 Million</li>
</ul>
<p>Instant 250,000, Instant 1,000,000, and Hold Bonus are always available from the beginning of each ball. Lite Extra Ball cannot be collected until after at least 1 prize has been lit on the current ball. <br>Lite 4 Million cannot be lit until the player has made 3 Spot Letter shots within any 18-second span on the current ball. When Lite 4 Million is collected, both entrances to the upper loop light for about 5 seconds for 2,000,000 points each- you need to be really quick and really accurate to get the full 4,000,000 out of this mini-mode. Once one of the secondary awards has been collected, it cannot be earned again until the current ball in play ends or until all 5 secondary awards have been collected.</p>

<p>The right in lane lights a 5X Spin. The next ramp shot within about 10 seconds will score 5X whatever value the wheel lands on (but the target value is not multiplied). </p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Bally Game Show has a conventional in/out lane setup. The left in lane lights the spinner for 3,000 a spin for a few seconds. The right in lane lights the center ramp for a 5x Wheel Spin for a few seconds. The out lanes are lit alternately for an extra ball by advancing the bonus to 4x.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Most lanes and targets advance the bonus (I have not figured out the exact distribution of this, but the top lanes and most letter targets seem to give 2 advances). Bonus multipliers are award by lighting all 3 top lanes, or by going through the center lane when it's flashing on a skill shot. Even though the table inserts look like they can count up to 15x 255,000 bonus, the actual maximum is 10x 250,000 = 2,500,000 points. Bonus tends not to hold too much value until at least 5x multiplier has been earned. Bonus and bonus multiplier are both held for the next ball only by collecting the Hold Bonus secondary wheel award, but there is no other way to hold bonus between balls and there is no mid-ball bonus collect.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>According to the manual, a special would be worth a pitiful 100,000 points, but there are no Special awards in this game. Presumably, an extra ball would give 100,000 points as well in competition/novelty play.</p>

<p>In lanes can be set to spot Prize Letters.</p>

<p>Lane change on the top lanes can be disabled.</p>

<p>The out lane extra ball can be set to light when 3x, 4x, or 8x (!) bonus is achieved.</p>

<p>The timers for the Nudge option on the wheel, the 5X Spin, the Grand Prize, and the 4 Million can be set to "yes" or "no", with "yes" being longer, but the exact length of each timer is not specified.</p>
