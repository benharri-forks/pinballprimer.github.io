<h1>Batman Forever (Sega, 1995)</h1>

<p>Not to be confused with any of these other Batman-themed tables, which are all officially just called Batman:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Batman (Data East, mini-DMD, 1991) - based on the 1989 film</li>
	<li>Batman (Stern, DMD, 2008) - based on the film called, and commonly referred to as, Batman: The Dark Knight</li>
	<li>Batman (Stern, LCD, 2016) - based on the 1966-68 TV series and commonly referred to as Batman '66</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Start modes with the skill shot or by hitting all 5 ? targets then making the right orbit. Hit shots with flashing bat symbols to lock them in. Complete the Cave drop targets in the lower left to light locks for multiball, then lock balls at the up-kicker. Match Two-Face's good and bad face targets for points and hold bonus. Complete all modes, light all bat signals, and match both the good and bad faces to light Forever wizard mode.</p>

<br>


<h2>A word on notation</h2>

<p>In-game, Batman Forever refers to the upper flipper shot as the Middle Ramp, and the ramp in the back of the game to the left of the up-kicker lane as the Mini-Ramp. I will be referring to the "Middle Ramp" as the Side Ramp and the Mini-Ramp as the Back Center Ramp to be consistent with other table's shot location descriptors.</p>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Skill shot</h3>

<p>There is no skill shot per se; you just get to choose one of 4 awards to start your ball with. The options are Lock Ball, Mr. E Mystery Award, Start Gotham Event, and Two-Face Pops. If all three locks are lit and/or multiball is ready, Lock Ball will be replaced with 25,000,000 points. Two-Face Pops make the pop bumpers worth 2,000,000 for the rest of the ball. Start Gotham Event lights the current mode (presumably this is also worth points if all 7 modes have been played but Forever is not ready, but I have not tested this). Mr. E Mystery is explained in more detail later.</p>

<h3>Gotham Events: modes</h3>

<p>There are 7 Gotham modes to play. Each bumper hit rotates the flashing mode. Shoot the right orbit when lit to start the flashing mode. If the right orbit is not lit, light it by hitting the 5 ? standup targets throughout the game- one on each side of the left ramp, and three that surround the up-kicker and the right ramp. Pressing the gun trigger ball launcher during gameplay will freeze or unfreeze the mode select; when frozen, bumpers will not rotate the flashing mode. The 7 modes are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Rooftop Chase:</b> a video mode. Press and hold left to move the Batmobile to the left lane, and press and hold right to move right. Whenever neither flipper is held, the Batmobile moves back to the middle automatically. There are two horizontal sections and two vertical sections. In the horizontal sections, avoid the obstacles on the roof. In the vertical sections, collect the 10,000,000 point cards. A successful completion of the video mode can score 150,000,000 points or more if you get a lot of the point cards.</li>
	<li><b>Too Many Question Marks:</b> the 5 ? targets score 20,000,000 apiece. Hit as many as you can in 20 seconds. Or don't, since these are drain targets and intentionally aiming at them is a center drain risk.</li>
	<li><b>Face Two-Face:</b> the are 4 Two-Face targets in the game: two in the lower right, and two directly up the middle. The goal is to hit each twice in 30 seconds. The first target scores 10,000,000 points. Each subsequent target scores 2,000,000 more than the last, with the 8th being worth 24,000,000. </li>
	<li><b>Crime Spree:</b> a 30-second frenzy mode. The frenzy value starts at 250,000 points. Hitting any switch in the game scores the frenzy value and adds the frenzy value to the Crime Jackpot. Every 10 switch hits increases the frenzy value by 250,000. Shoot the right ramp to collect the Crime Jackpot as many times as possible (it does not reset once collected).</li>
	<li><b>Brain Drain:</b> you have 30 seconds to hit the 4 Cave drop targets <i>in order</i> from left to right to spell Cave. The C, A, V, and E score 20,000,000, then 25,000,000, then 30,000,000, then 35,000,000 points. However, hitting a target out of sequence resets the spelling and scores 10,000,000. This mode is also best left ignored because of the risk of an out of control ball or a left out lane drain.</li>
	<li><b>Safe Trap:</b> you have 30 seconds to shoot the 4 ramps in the game (left, side, back center, and right). Each one scores 25,000,000 points. There is a 50,000,000 completion bonus for making all 4 within the time limit.</li>
	<li><b>Lit Extra Ball:</b> at the up-kicker. There is no time limit to collect.</li>
</ul>
<p>Playing the 7 Gotham Events is one of the requirements for starting Forever wizard mode.</p>

<h3>Bat Signals</h3>

<p>The 7 major shots in the game (both orbits, all 4 ramps, and the up-kicker) all have a Bat Signal in front of them. One signal will be flashing; make that shot to permanently light that signal. The flashing light cannot move to a shot whose signal has been lit. Lighting the first bat signal scores 5,000,000 points; subsequent bat signals score 5,000,000 more than the previous, up until the 6th signal scores 30,000,000; the 7th bat signal scores 50,000,000 points and immediately starts a Circus Hurry-up worth up to 99,000,000 points that is collectible at the right orbit. <br>Lighting the 7 Bat Signals is one of the requirements for starting Forever wizard mode.</p>

<h3>Two-Face Coin targets</h3>

<p>Shoot a flashing Two-Face target to lock in the Good or Bad Face at that bank. Lock in a face at both banks (center and lower right) to receive an award. Matching the Good Faces awards Hold Bonus. Matching the Bad Faces scores 22,000,000 points. Matching one Good Face and one Bad Face scores just 2,000,000 points. Making a match that has already been made relights the left kickback, or awards 10,000,000 points if the kickback was light. Making a Good Face Match and making a Bad Face Match are both requirements for starting Forever wizard mode.</p>

<h3>Forever: wizard mode</h3>

<p>After playing all 7 Gotham Scenes, lighting all 7 Bat signals, and making both a Good Face Match and a Bad Face Match, the Forever wizard mode is qualified. Just like other modes, light it by completing the ? targets and start it at the right orbit. Forever is a 3-ball multiball with 60 seconds of unlimited ball save. The Forever Jackpot starts at 50,000,000 points. Every switch in the game increases the Forever Jackpot by 1,000,000 points times the number of balls in play. To collect the Forever Jackpot, shoot the left ramp such that the ball falls into the Batwing toy that is constantly rotating. (The ball enters the Batwing when the Batwing is vertical.) The Forever Jackpot can be collected multiple times, but resets back to 50,000,000 once collected. Forever mode lasts until there is only one ball left in play and the 60-second ball saver has run out.</p>

<h3>Multiball</h3>

<p>To lock a ball, complete the Cave drop targets in the lower left of the game, then shoot the up-kicker between the right ramp and the back center ramp. Balls can also be locked for free with the respective skill shot award. Lock 3 balls to start Multiball. For the first multiball, completing Cave once will light all three locks; for the second multiball, Cave lights locks 1+2 the first time, and lock 3 the second time; for the third multiball and onward, Cave is needed to light each individual lock.<br><b>Multiball stage 1: Save Chase and Robin.</b> The left and right ramps are each lit for their own jackpot. The ramp jackpot starts at 50,000,000 points. The two jackpots can individually be raised by hitting the ? targets on either side of their ramps. Make both ramp jackpots to advance.<br><b>Multiball stage 2: Two-Face's Double Jackpot.</b> The side ramp is now a jackpot equal to the sum of the collected values of the first two jackpots. On the first multiball, the side ramp will be lit right away. On subsequent multiballs, you must hit the 4 Two-Face Coin targets in the center and lower right of the playfield to light the side ramp. Make one double jackpot to advance.<br><b>Multiball Stage 3: Batwing Super Jackpot.</b> Shoot the left ramp to load the Batwing, then fire the ball from the Batwing to the back center ramp for a 250,000,000 point Super Jackpot. If you miss, you may get one or two chances to reload the Batwing and try again. If you run out of chances or collect the Super Jackpot, you return to stage 1, and the cycle repeats until single ball play resumes.</p>

<h3>Batwing Cannon</h3>

<p>Make the number of shots to the side ramp, back center ramp, and right ramp shown on the DMD to light the left ramp for Arm Batwing. Shoot the left ramp to load a ball into the Batwing, then pull the trigger to launch it at the upper right corner of the table. If you make a shot, you get normal credit for that shot. Hitting a lit target scores 10,000,000 points, and hitting an unlit target scores 1,000,000. Complete the Batwing targets to light an extra ball.</p>

<h3>Up-kicker and Mr. E Mystery</h3>

<p>When the up-kicker is not lit for Lock or Mr. E, shooting it will collect a Gadget. Collect all 10 Gadgets for Super Laser Kick, which is an unlimited left out lane kickback for the rest of the ball.</p>

<p>Shots to the back center ramp progress toward Mr. E's Mystery, which is also collected at the up-kicker lane when lit. The first mystery requires 2 back center ramps, the second requires 3 more, etc. A Mystery can also be collected for free as the skill shot option. Possible mystery awards that I've seen include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Points: 10,000,000, 20,000,000, or 50,000,000</li>
	<li>20X Bonus (this can be very ridiculous, since max bonus is usually 10X)</li>
	<li>Super Laser Kick (unlimited kickback for the rest of the ball)</li>
	<li>Mega Pops (3,000,000 per bumper for the rest of the ball)</li>
	<li>Light extra ball: at the next shot to the up-kicker</li>
	<li>Start Gotham Scene</li>
	<li>Instant extra ball</li>
</ul>
<p>On tournament settings, Mr. E gives awards in the same order every time for everyone. I do not know what this order is.</p>

<h3>Top B-A-T lanes</h3>

<p>Go through an unlit lane to light it. Lights can be rotated in either direction via flipper lane change. Light all 3 letters in B-A-T to advance the bonus multiplier in the sequence of 2x-4x-6x-8x-10x, and relight the left out lane kickback. If bonus has been maxed at 10x, or if 20x bonus was collected from Mr. E, completing B-A-T awards 20,000,000 points alongside the kickback relight.</p>

<h3>Bumpers</h3>

<p>By default, they score 250,000 points each, and every 10 hits over the course of the ball increases their value by a further 250,000, up to a maximum of 1,000,000 per hit. The only way for the bumper value to exceed 1,000,000 is by selected the Two-Face Pops skill shot option or getting Mega Pops from Mr. E to advance the value to 2,000,000 or 3,000,000 per hit respectively for the rest of that ball.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Batman Forever has a conventional in/out lane setup, but with two in lanes on the right side instead of one. <br>The out lanes can be lit for a special and I honestly don't know how: it doesn't seem to be tied to game progress or starting Forever or collecting a super jackpot. Maybe it's an ultra-rare Mr. E award I've never seen. Oh well. The left out lane has a kickback, called Laser Kick. It is typically on at the start of each ball and turns off after being used. Kickback can be relit by completing the B-A-T top lanes or collecting a Two-Face Match that has already been collected. The Kickback can be upgraded into a Super Laser Kick that is permanently on for the rest of the ball via a Mr. E award or collecting all 10 Gadgets.<br>Going through the left in lane and then immediately shooting the right ramp gives 2 shots' worth of credit toward the next Batwing Cannon. Going through the near right in lane then shooting a left orbit -> side ramp combo gives Double Batarang, which scores 20,000,000 points (that combo typically scores only 10,000,000). Going through the far right in lane then immediately shooting the left ramp if it is lit for Arm Cannon will double the value of the next Batwing Cannon shot.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is calculated as 500,000 points times the number of ramp shots on the current ball, plus 2,000,000 points times the number of Cannon shots on the current ball, plus 3,000,000 times the number of Gotham Events completed in the game so far, all multiplied by the bonus multiplier. All components of the bonus calculation except for the number of Events played reset between balls unless the Hold Bonus award was collected by making a Good Face Match. Bonus multiplier is advanced by B-A-T lane completions in the order of 2x-4x-6x-8x-10x, or the bonus multiplier can be overloaded to 20x from a Mr. E Mystery award. Bonus tends not to be worth much unless you get to at least 8x bonus; it's overpoweringly good if you get the 20x award. There is no mid-ball bonus collect.</p>
