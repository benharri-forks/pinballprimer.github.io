<h1>Blue Chip (Williams, 1976)</h1>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Collect the 1-6 numbers from around the playfield as quickly as possible, because lit numbers and the features they make available persist from ball to ball. Once this is done, shoot lit spinners or lit center targets based on where the ball is and what is safe on you machine. If playing exclusively for points, you may want to actively ignore the 7 and 8 targets, because completing 1-8 lights the game's specials, including at the upper right saucer- special can be worth 100,000 points, but it can also be worth 0 points in the form of extra ball, a free game, or nothing, whereas just collecting 1-2-3 makes the saucer worth a safe 50,000.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Skill shot: top saucer</h3>

<p>Try to plunge the top saucer, as that's likely the only time the ball will end up there. The saucer scores 5,000 points and 2 bonus advances. Some machines may have a friendly kickout where the saucer spits the ball directly off the left pop bumper, which reflects perfectly back into the saucer. If you can help make this happen more with good nudging, you should absolutely try to do so.</p>

<h3>Bumpers</h3>

<p>Exactly one of the two bumpers is always lit. Unlit bumpers score 10 points, lit bumpers score 100 points. 10-point switches, which include the slingshots, the switches on the top side of the house-shaped structure in the middle, and the unlit bumper itself, will toggle which bumper is lit.</p>

<h3>Numbered targets</h3>

<p>1 and 2 are above the left pop bumper. 3 is above the right pop bumper. 4-5-6 are in the dead center of the table. 7 and 8 are the lower left and lower right targets. Hitting a number standup target always scores 1,000 points, and lights that target if it is not lit already.<br>Collecting 1 and 4 lights the left upper side lane for double bonus. Collecting 3 and 6 lights the right upper side lane for double bonus.<br>Collecting 2 lights the left spinner for 1,000 points per spin, and collecting 5 lights the right spinner for the same.<br>Collecting 1-2-3 lights the upper right saucer (the light is the saucer itself, not something in front of it) for a repeatable 50,000 points. <br>Collecting 4-5-6 lights the 4-5-6 targets for 10,000 points and a bonus advance for each subsequent hit. <br>Collecting 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8 (or just 1-2-3-4-5-6 on easy settings) lights the specials: one on the out lanes which alternates with 10-point switch hits, and one at the upper right saucer. Special can be worth a free game, an extra ball, 100,000 points, or nothing. Multiple specials can be collected in one ball. This game is add-a-ball convertible, so if special is set to extra ball, more than one extra ball can be earned per ball in play as well. The upper right saucer being lit for special overwrites the 50,000 points opportunity from just getting 1-2-3, so in a tournament setting, it may be wise to intentionally avoid lighting the specials so that you can continue to collect the 50,000 from the upper right saucer.</p>

<p>All numbers and rewards therein, including lit spinners, lit double bonus lanes, the upper right saucer values, and lit specials, are always carried over from ball to ball. Once something is lit, it stays lit for the whole game.</p>

<h3>Upper side lanes</h3>

<p>Score 10,000 points and a bonus advance. When lit (by collecting numbers 1 and 4 on the left side, or 3 and 6 for the right side), these lanes award double bonus for that ball. <br>These lanes can be made from below, but it's a very precise shot that sends the ball wildly out of control on a miss, especially if you miss too late. It's more common to enter these lanes from the top, but beware of a ball coming down and being deflected directly into the center drain. If a ball is coming down this lane, you will probably want to nudge it off the slanted wall to ensure it falls to the opposite flipper rather than the center drain.</p>

<h3>Spinners</h3>

<p>Score 100 points per spin when not lit, and 1,000 per spin when lit. #2 lights the left spinner, and #5 lights the right. Because of the spinners' positions and how they face the bottom of the table directly while being placed close to the edges of the playfield, it can be difficult to rip these well. A shot to these spinners typically bounces off the wall just behind/outside them and directly into a pop bumper.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Blue Chip has a conventional in/out lane setup. In lanes always give 5,000 points. Out lanes give 10,000 points and a bonus advance, and are alternately lit for special by completing the 1-8 targets. Therr are no gates, kickbacks, or center posts.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is advanced twice by the top saucer, or once by upper side lanes, out lanes, or lit center targets. The upper right saucer also advances bonus if special is not lit. One bonus advance is worth 5,000 points rather than the conventional 1,000. The first 5,000 bonus is given for free. Max base bonus is 50,000 points. Double bonus is achieved by rolling through a lit upper side lane (see above). Max bonus is 2x 50,000 = 100,000 points. There is no holdover to base bonus or bonus multiplier, and there is no mid-ball bonus collect; however, all collected number targets are preserved from ball to ball, so the upper side lanes will be lit for double bonus for the rest of the game once they have been qualified.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>Specials can be worth 100,000 points, a free game, an extra ball, or nothing.</p>

<p>A tilt can be set to end the entire game or just the current ball.</p>

<p>Special can be lit by just collecting 1 through 6 instead of 1 through 8.</p>

<p>There are no inate scoring differences if the game is set to 3 balls instead of 5.</p>
