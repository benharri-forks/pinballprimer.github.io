<h1 style="text-align:center">Bronco / Mustang (Gottlieb, 1977)</h1>

<p>Bronco is the 4-player version. Mustang is the otherwise identical 2-player version. This version of Mustang is about horses and the old west, and it is not to be confused with Mustang (Stern Pinball, 2014) which is themed around the Ford car.</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Plunge the A lane, then shoot for the saucers in the top corners of the game as much as possible. Only shoot the drop targets if you think it's safe to, or if it's the final ball of the game. A-B-C doubles bonus, or turns your double bonus into 4x bonus on the final ball. Clearing the drop targets lights the upper side lanes for extra ball at certain bonus counts. A-B-C and the drop targets light special at the A top lane.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>All top lanes score 300 points and a bonus advance. Roll through a lit lane to unlight it. Notice that the lanes are ordered B-A-C rather than A-B-C. B and C can be collected from the in lanes later, but it's nearly impossible to get back to these lanes mid-ball, so it is absolutely paramount that the A lane be made on the plunge. Special is lit at the center A lane if A-B-C have all been collected and the drop targets have all been cleared.</p>

<h3>Bumpers</h3>

<p>The two outer bumpers always score 100 points. The center bumper scores 1,000 in a 3-ball game, but only 10 in a 5-ball game. If the saucers are set to alternate being lit for bonus advances, the center bumper is what will toggle them.</p>

<h3>Drop targets and upper saucers</h3>

<p>Each drop target down scores 300 points and a bonus advance, and lights a white spot at at least one of the saucers. Saucers always score 3,000 points, and they also give 1 bonus advance for each lit white spot in front of them. The game can be set so that both saucers are lit with white spots at the same time, or just one at a time alternating each time the center pop bumper is hit. <br>These saucers are the best source of points and bonus in the game. Be sure to master getting control of the return feed from them regardless of whether drop targets are still standing or not.</p>

<h3>Side lanes</h3>

<p>On each side of the table, there is a 100 point side lane positioned immediately above a kicker that shoots directly upwards. <br>The 100 point lanes are lit "occasionally" for extra ball once the drop targets have been completed. Extra ball availability is dependent on the current base bonus level. In a 5-ball game, extra ball will be lit on the left at 3,000 and 7,000, and it will be lit on the right at 5,000 and 9,000. In a 3-ball game, in addition to all of the 5-ball positions, extra ball will also be lit on the left at 6,000 and 14,000, and on the right at 4,000 and 12,000.<br>The kickers score 500 points and will almost always pop the ball directly into the top saucers, so they're worth nudging into if possible.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Bronco has a conventional in/out lane setup. All in/out lanes score 300 points and a bonus advance. The out lanes both give the letter A, the left in lane gives B, and the right in lane gives C. Notice that the top of the rail dividing the in and out lanes is much lower than the top of the slingshot and does not have a rubber on it. It's best to avoid an in/out lane decision whenever possible. There are no kickbacks, out lane gates, or center pegs.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Top lanes, drop targets, and in/out lanes always give 1 bonus advance. Top saucers give between 0 and 3 bonus advances based on the number of lit white lights, which is in turn based on the number of drop targets you've hit. Max base bonus is 15,000 points. Bonus can be doubled by collecting A, B, and C in the same ball. On the final ball of the game, double bonus is given for free, and collecting A-B-C will turn the 2x bonus into a 4x bonus. There is no mid-ball bonus collect. Base bonus and multiplier can never be carried from ball to ball.</p>
