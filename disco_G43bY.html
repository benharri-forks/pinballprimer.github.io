<h1 style="color:yellow;">Disco (Stern Electronics, 1977)</h1>

<p>Not to be confused with Disco Fever (Williams, 1978).</p>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Bonus is king. Double the bonus at the top center standup target, then triple it at that same target after collecting D-I-S-C. Use the spinners to advance bonus; both spinners count toward the 10 spins for the next bonus advance, but only the lit spinner will actually advance that bonus, the other one will just reset the 10-count. The "advance and change" rollover button switches which spinner is lit on that 10th spin. Once bonus is maxed at 3x 100,000, collect the O and shoot the left side lane for the 10,000 point rollover buttons.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Disco letters</h3>

<p>5 standup targets around the playfield correspond to the 5 letters in D-I-S-C-O: D is in the lower left, I is in the upper left, and S-C-O are in the middle right. All letter targets score 1,000 points and collect that letter if they are lit. The D and I can also be spotted by the left and right top lanes, and the S and C can also be spotted by the left and right in lanes, but O cannot be spotted anywhere. The top D and I lanes score 1,000, and the in lanes score 5,000.</p>

<p>Collecting the D, I, S, and C lights the top center standup target for Triple Bonus, but only if the Double Bonus has already been earned. <br>Collecting the S, C, and O lights the rollover buttons in the left side lane for 10,000 points each instead of 1,000. <br>Collecting all five letters in Disco lights a special in one of the out lanes.</p>

<h3>Spinners</h3>

<p>Each spinner scores 100 points per spin. Every 10 spins of either spinner advances the bonus- sort of. Both spinners can advance the lights on the playfield, but after 9 spins, only one of the spinners will be lit for the bonus advance, and going through the other spinner just resets the count with no bonus advance. Which spinner is available for the bonus advance alternates every time an "advance and change" rollover button is hit. It's not especially clear which spinner is going to be the one to light up unless the next spin would be the 10th one: know that if the bumpers are currently on, the <b>left</b> spinner will be the bonus advance. <br>Despite the somewhat complicated and unorthodox rules, sending the spinners flying is the best way to build bonus (and it's just really satisfying).</p>

<h3>Left side lane</h3>

<p>Each individual button in this lane scores 1,000 points, or 10,000 when lit. All five buttons are lit by collecting all three of the S-C-O letters. Don't shoot for this lane directly until you've collected S-C-O <i>and</i> maxed out the bonus at 3x 100,000 points- only then does this become meaningful.</p>

<h3>Advance and change buttons</h3>

<p>There are two: one in the very top center of the table above the top lanes, and one in the lower playfield between the flippers and spinners. Rolling over one of these advances the bonus and toggles the state of the following alternating features:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Whether or not the upper right lane is lit for 1,000 points instead of 100</li>
	<li>Whether or not the bumpers are lit for 1,000 points isntead of 100</li>
	<li>Which of the two spinners will be lit for advance bonus on spin #10</li>
	<li>Which of the two in lanes is lit for extra ball if the current base bonus is exactly 40,000 or 90,000</li>
	<li>Which of the two out lanes it lit for special if Disco has been completed</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Disco has a conventional in/out lane setup. The out lanes score 10,000 points, or a special when lit by spelling Disco. The in lanes score 5,000 points, spot the S or C letters when lit white, and can be lit yellow for an extra ball if the current base bonus count is exactly 40,000 or 90,000. The side on which an extra ball or a special is lit alternates with the Advance and Change button feature (<i>not</i> due to switch hits as would be the case on many games).</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is advanced by hitting a lit spinner (see Spinners section above) or rolling over an Advance and Change button. Notice that a single bonus advance is worth 10,000 points in bonus rather than the conventional 1,000. Bonus multiplier can be advanced to 2x by hitting the top center standup target right away on the ball; that same target can be lit for 3x bonus once both the 2x and the D-I-S-C letters are collected. MAx bonus is 3x 100,000 = 300,000 points. Bonus and bonus multiplier can never be carried from ball to ball, and there is no mid-ball bonus collect.</p>
