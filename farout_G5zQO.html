<h1>Far Out / Out of Sight (Gottlieb, 1974)</h1>

<p>Far Out is the 4 player version. Out of Sight is the 2 player version. All scoring and rules are identical between the two versions.</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Shoot to the top of the table on either side of the center bumper until the ball has gone down both side lanes and both out lane gates are open. Then, focus on drop targets, Drop targets score 50 if unlit, 500 if lit once, and 5,000 if lit twice. 100-point bumpers alternate which side is lit for the table's alternating features, and the star rollover in table center rotates which single target in each bank is lit separately.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>The center lane and one of the two lanes on either side of it are lit. Unlit lanes score 50 points. Lit lanes score 500 points and a bonus advance. The yellow bumpers alternate which lane out of the left and right is lit.</p>

<h3>Bumpers</h3>

<p>The two yellow bumpers score 10 points when not lit, or 100 points when lit. These bumpers alternate many features throughout the game: whether the left or right top lane is lit, whether the bumpers are on or off, which side lane is lit, which in lane is lit, and which bank of drop targets is lit.</p>

<p>The center bumper scores 100 points when not lit or 1,000 when lit.</p>

<h3>Side lanes</h3>

<p>Score 50 points, or 500 points and a bonus advance when lit. One of the two will always be lit, alternating each time a yellow bumper is triggered. The left side lane always opens the left out lane gate, qualifying the kickback. The right side lane always opens the right out lane gate, which redirects the ball back to the shooter lane.</p>

<h3>Drop targets</h3>

<p>Each target scores a bonus advance. Targets can be lit in two ways: one of the two banks will be lit alternating with yellow bumper hits, and one of the 5 targets in each bank will be individually lit rotating with the 100-point star rollover just below the 1,000 bumper. Targets that are completely unlit score 50 points. Targets lit in just one of the two ways score 500. Targets that are lit in both ways score 5,000 points. <br>Drop targets never reset once completed. Clearing both sets of drop targets lights double bonus for the end of that ball.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Far Out has a conventional in/out lane setup. In lanes score 50 points, or 500 points and a bonus advance when lit. One in lane is lit at a time, alternating with each yellow bumper hit. Out lanes score 500 points and a bonus advance, or Special when lit. Out lanes are lit for special when the base bonus is exactly equal to 10,000 or 15,000 points.</p>

<p>There are saver gates available in both out lanes. When the left gate is open, a kickback saucer is available that will send the ball back into play. When the right gate is open, an out lane ball will be redirected back to the shooter lane for a replunge. Both gates are opened by the side lane behind the drop targets on the corresponding side of the table, and will close once used. Notably, the right out lane gate is situated above the out lane rollover switch, meaning you cannot collect a special and save the ball on the right side; an out lane special can only be "safely" collected via use of the kickback on the left.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is advanced by lit top lanes, lit side lanes, lit in lanes, and any drop target. Max base bonus is 15,000 points. When the bonus is exactly 10,000 or 15,000 points, both out lanes are lit for a special. Clearing both banks of drop targets lights double bonus. Double bonus is also given for free on the final ball of the game. There is no additional award for clearing all drop targets on the final ball when double bonus has already been awarded. Max bonus is 2x 15,000 = 30,000 points. There is no mid-ball bonus collect, nor is there any way to hold base bonus or the multiplier over to the next ball.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous notes</h3>

<p>Special cannot be set to be worth points. There are no extra balls at all.</p>

<p>Beware the slow EM scoring in this game. While the game is counting the 50, 500, or 5,000 points that various features award, the entire playfield unlights to show that the score motor is occupied. If you, for example, hit one drop target into another, or go through a top lane en route to the 1,000 point bumper, the second scoring feature cannot register while the first is still being counted. For the drop targets specifically and especially, try to hit just one at a time where possible to get all of the bonus advances.</p>
