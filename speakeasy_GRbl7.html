<h1>Speakeasy (Bally, 1982)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Complete the 5-9 lanes and 10-Ace targets as many times as possible for bonus multipliers, which affect both the end of ball bonus and the point values on the wheel. Completing 5-9 or 10-Ace in sequence awards add-a-balls. If you go out of sequence on 5-9, a second button on the left side of the cabinet can be pushed to restore sequence at the cost of points. For a quick extra ball in a pinch, shoot the right saucer repeatedly.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>5-9 top lanes and upper right lane</h3>

<p>There are 5 top lanes. Going through an unlit lane scores 500 points, lights the lane, and advances the value of the star rollover in the upper right lane by 5,000 points. Going through a lit 5-9 lane scores 5,000 points. 5-9 lanes always give 1 bonus advance whether lit or not.</p>

<p>Any completion of 5-9 advances the bonus multiplier. Completing 5-9 twice in a game awards an add-a-ball, and completing it three times awards a special. Also, the upper right lane can be lit for special if 5-9 is completed while the star rollover's value is maxed out at 25,000. </p>

<p>Completing 5-9 in sequence awards 2 add-a-balls. Depending on game settings, "in sequence" can mean only 5-6-7-8-9 from left to right, or 9-8-7-6-5 from right to left can be allowed as well. If the lanes have been lit in sequence so far, the center light above the top lanes will be lit.<br>Between balls, players can choose to return to being in sequence by pressing a button on the side of the cabinet (or the left magna-save button in VPX). Doing so will unlight all of the 5-9 lanes that were collected out of sequence at the cost of 25,000 points each.</p>

<p>If set to points, specials score 50,000 and add-a-balls score 25,000.</p>

<h3>10-Ace targets and spinner</h3>

<p>Termed "flyaway targets", the 10 through Ace targets are hanging targets that will stick and stay up once hit hard enough- think of them as reverse drop targets. They don't always work great though, sometimes a target will register but fall back down or stay up but not register. </p>

<p>Any completion of 10-Ace advances the bonus multiplier and the spinner value, and scores and advances the lit chip value. Spinner values are 500 - 1,000 - 2,000 - 3,000 - 5,000 per spin. Bonus multipliers go 2X-3X-5X-10X. Chip values increase in 25,000 point increments. Lighting the 125,000 point chip lights a special on the right out lane and also on the next completion of 10-Ace.</p>

<p>Completing 10-Ace in sequence from left to right scores 1 add-a-ball. Ace through 10 from right to left does not count. These targets reset from ball to ball, so there is no return to sequence feature like there is for the 5-9 lanes.</p>

<h3>Left and right saucers, joker lane, and big wheel</h3>

<p>The left saucer ejects the ball toward the right flipper. The right saucer ejects the ball toward the right joker lane. Every 4th trip through the joker lane adds a ball. The ball usually comes down the joker lane fast enough that the ball can be ski passed back to the left flipper, where the right saucer can be shot again; this loop can be good for grabbing an extra ball in a pinch.</p>

<p>Slingshots and bumpers will occasionally light the saucers, at which point landing in the saucer will spin the wheel in the playfield. The wheel also gets spun when the ball drains. It acts like a mini-roulette wheel, spinning for a while before a small pinball lands in one of the holes. <br>6 of the spaces score 3,000 points. 4 of the spaces score 15,000 points. The red space adds a ball. But look out for that black space Subtract a Ball: land on that and you'll instantly lose a ball, but not your score, because once you collect a bonus it's yours to keep.<br>It is possible to have negative balls remaining in this game. The ball or game does not end immediately if the wheel drops you down to 0 or negative balls; you can still play the rest of the current ball to get back into the positives and earn another turn, and dropping to -1 or -2 balls makes that harder but still not impossible.</p>

<p>The lit bonus multiplier also applies to the score wedges on the wheel (but not the Add or Subtract a Ball). This makes the wheel worth very good value on a ball that gets the bonus multiplier to 5X or 10X. </p>

<h3>Lower left standup target and bottom of the playfield</h3>

<p>The left standup target advances the value of the left out lane by 5,000 at a time; advnacing it again when it's at 20,000 lights the left out lane for special.</p>

<p>In and out lanes are reversed compared to a conventional setup. On the left, the lane closer to the edge of the table as the in lane and feeds the flipper, while the lane closer to the flippers is the out lane and drops the ball straight out of play. The left in lane scores 5,000 points always, and scores 4 bonus advance when lit.<br>The right in and out lane have the same structure, but the joker lane is also the right in lane, so it begins much higher up on the playfield near the saucer. 4 trips through the joker lane adds 1 ball. The left out lane is lit for special when the chip value on the 10 through Ace flyaway targets reaches 125,000. </p>

<p>Note that there is a one way gate above the left flipper preventing the ball from rolling back down into the out lane, but there is not such a gate on the right. This means two things: 1) it's safer to trap a ball on the left than the right by simply holding the flipper up, and 2) it is possible, though very dangerous, to alley pass the joker lane from the left flipper and get credit for two jokers. <br>As with any reversed in/out lane setup, try to nudge the ball back into play off one of the corners of the gap where the in and out lanes cross.</p>

<p>There are a lot of lights and inserts at the bottom of the playfield, both when considering all the bonus number lights and the big wheel itself. Pay extra close attention to any ball near the flippers so you can adjust if any of the stuff in the playfield surface affects the ball's speed, spin, or trajectory.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>The top 5-9 lanes, the star rollover in the upper right lane, and the lower left standup target score 1 bonus advance. The left in lane scores 4 bonus advance when lit (toggled by slingshots). Bonus is carried from ball to ball. Max base bonus is 60+30+15+14 = 119,000 points. <br>Bonus multiplier is advanced by any completion of the 5-9 lanes or 10-Ace targets, and is advanced in the order of 2X-3X-5X-10X. A full bonus collect is a whopping 10x 119,000 = 1,190,000 points. Bonus multiplier is never carried from ball to ball, but does apply to the 3,000 and 15,000 point wedges of the big wheel.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>The top lanes can be set to recognize only 5-6-7-8-9 as in sequence, or both 5-6-7-8-9 and 9-8-7-6-5.<br>Specials can be set to score a free game, an extra ball, or 50,000 points. Add-a-balls can be set to score an extra ball or 25,000 points.<br>The maximum allowed number of balls can be set to 6, 7, 8, or 9. If an extra ball is earned when the ball count is at maximum, that extra ball scores 25,000 points. If special is set to award an extra ball and a special is earned while the ball count is at max, that special scores 50,000 points.<br>Beating the current high score to date, or rolling the score over at 10,000,000 points, gives an adjustable award of either 0, 1, 2, or 3 credits (default 3).</p>

<p>Speakeasy is a 2 player game. A rare variant of the game called Speakeasy 4 designed exclusively for foreign export outside of the United States exists, and is a 4 player game instead. As far as I am aware, all rules are identical in Speakeasy 4.</p>
