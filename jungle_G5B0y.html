<h1>Jungle, Wild Life, Jungle King, Jungle Life (Gottlieb, 1972/1973)</h1>

<p>Jungle is the original 4-player replay version. Wild Life is the 2-player variant. These versions are the primary focus of the guide.
<br>Jungle King and Jungle Life are two names for the same 1-player add-a-ball version. Changes seen in these variants are mentioned at the end of the guide.
<br>These games are not to be confused with Jungle Queen or Jungle Princess (Gottlieb, 1976) or Jungle Lord (Williams, 1981).</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Shoot the orbits as often as possible. At the beginning of the ball, this is just to get bonus advances from the star rollovers until bonus is maxed at 10,000 points; after that, you specifically want to end up in the center top lane with the goal of getting stuck in the bumper chamber for 1,000 point bumpers as long as possible. On Jungle King/Life, double bonus is skill based and attainable on every ball by making that center top lane. Do not ever shoot the spinner/pop bumper chamber from below.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>Three in total. The left and right lanes score 500 points and put the ball out of control, bouncing the ball sideways off the edge of the bumper chamber and down the orbit in an unpredictable arc. The center top lane scores 1,000 points, lights the bumper if it is not already lit, and directs the ball into the bumper chamber (as well as lighting double bonus on the add-a-ball versions of the game only).</p>

<h3>Bumper chamber</h3>

<p>The bumper scores 100 points when not lit, or 1,000 when lit. 10-point switches alternate whether the bumper is lit or not, but it will always be lit if you entered the chamber from the top lane above it. Nudge where possible to get the ball to bounce off the bumper as many times as possible before trickling out the bottom gap spinner. The spinner always scores exactly 10 points per spin. Do not try to enter the bumper chamber from below, as the spinner makes it a crapshoot as to whether the bumper is lit or not and the bumper will more likely than not bounce the ball straight back at you anyway.<br>On either side of the spinner that marks the exit to the chamber are standup targets that always score 500 points.</p>

<h3>Orbit shots: star rollovers</h3>

<p>Each score 100 points and a bonus advance. Max bonus is only 10,000 points, so bonus can be maxed out by one trip down and one trip up the orbit(s) or two shots to the top. Shots from the flippers to the orbits are deceptively tight due to the posts that lie just outside the standup targets below the center bumper chamber.</p>

<h3>Side lanes</h3>

<p>The left side lane opens the kickback in the left out lane. The right side lane opens the gate in the right out lane. Both lanes score 500 points. They are lit alternately for Special (toggling on 10-point switches) when the bonus is maxed out at 10,000 points.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Jungle has a conventional in/out lane setup. Out lanes score 1,000 points. In lanes score 500 points. The left out lane has an automatic kickback that is lit by making the left upper side lane or the left in lane. The right out lane has a gate that directs the ball back to the shooter lane, which is opened by making the upper right side lane or the right in lane. Both the kickback and the gate close once used but can be reopened at any time.<br>The slingshots score 10 points, or 100 when lit. Which of the two slingshots is lit alternates every time a 10-point switch is made.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is advanced by any star rollover, and that's it. Max bonus is 10,000 points. You are not given 1,000 bonus points for free at the start of each ball; it's possible to drain with no bonus. Bonus is doubled on the final ball of the game only. There is no bonus hold, multiplier hold, or mid-ball bonus collect.</p>

<h2>Differences in Jungle King and Jungle Life, the add-a-ball versions</h2>

<p>Star rollovers still give 100 points and a bonus advance. At the beginning of the game, all 10 are lit. Rolling over a lit star unlights it. Unlighting all 10- which can be done across multiple balls- lights the upper side lanes and the standup targets alternately for Wow (extra ball) for the remainder of that ball in play. Lit Wows alternate between the left standup target and the right side lane, or the right standup target and the left side lane, every time a 10-point switch is hit.</p>

<p>The bumper in the chamber is always lit for 1,000 points. There is no spinner at the exit to the chamber. The center top lane which serves as the entrance to the chamber will light double bonus on any ball; double bonus is not given for free at any time.</p>
