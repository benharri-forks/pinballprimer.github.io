<h1 style="text-align:center">Millionaire (Williams, 1987)</h1>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Try to always be in multiball. Multiball is never more than two shots away: one at the left ramp, and one at the right quasi-orbit that loops around the bumpers. During multiball, relock both balls within 12 seconds of each other as many times as possible for increasing jackpots. In lanes light the opposite saucer near the bottom of the table for a spin of the in-table roulette wheel. The upper flipper shot into the inline drop targets awards bonus multipliers.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Skill shot and inline drop targets</h3>

<p>The skill shot is a timed full plunge. A one-way gate at the end of the shooter lane constantly rotates back and forth. The ball's direction coming out of the shooter lane depends on where in its swing this gate is. The goal is to release the plunger so that the gate deflects the ball into the inline drop target lane in the upper left of the playfield. It's easier said than done, and it's not said very easily; luckily, bonus tends not to be particularly valuable on this game. During the skill shot, the left out lane gate is open until a switch is hit anywhere on the table, so it's not possible to plunge the out lane.</p>

<p>Inline drop targets score 5,000 points and increase the bonus multiplier to 2x then 3x. The first hit to the standup target behind the inlines also scores 5,000 points and jumps the bonus multiplier to 5x. Additional shots to the standup target on the same ball score 50,000, then 75,000, then a repeatable 100,000 points. Hitting any target in this lane also opens the right out lane get for about 5 seconds.</p>

<h3>Locks and multiball</h3>

<p>Locks are always lit during single ball play. The left lock is the black plastic ramp. The right lock is the looping lane that goes around the bumpers. Lock a ball in both places to start multiball. If you shoot a lock that already has a ball in it, the locked ball will be swapped for the ball you just shot. Lock stealing is always available during multiplayer games.</p>

<p>Multiball is always 2-ball on Millionaire. During multiball, the goal is to relock the 2 balls at the two different locks within about 12 seconds of each other to score jackpots. The first jackpot in a game scores the Emerald value, worth at least 100,000. The second jackpot is the Ruby, worth at least 250,000. The third jackpot is the Diamond, worth at least 500,000. Any jackpots after the third are Hotshot, which always score exactly 500,000 points. Every time a ball in play ends, the Emerald, Ruby, and Diamond jackpots are all increased by 5,000 points, up to a maximum of 500,000 for Emerald, 1,000,000 for Ruby, and 2,000,000 for Diamond. Jackpot progress continues across multiballs for the length of the game. Collecting any jackpot resets that jackpot back to its base value.</p>

<h3>Money targets</h3>

<p>Hit an unlit target to scores 5,000 points and a bonus advance, as well as light that target. Lit targets score 1,000 points and no bonus. Spell Money to score 50,000 points and open the left out lane gate for 5 seconds.</p>

<h3>Bank targets, gold and silver target, hold bonus</h3>

<p>Like the Money targets, the Bank targets score 5,000 points and a bonus advance when not lit, or 1,000 points when lit. Hit all 4 targets to spell Bank. Complete Bank once to light the gold and silver target next to the bottom pop bumper for Silver, worth 10,000 points, and also open the right out lane gate for 5 seconds. Collect the Silver and then complete Bank again to light the gold and silver target for Gold, also worth 10,000 points. After collecting Gold, the standup target next to the right saucer will be lit for Cash Held, which is this game's bonus holdover. Gold and Silver awards can continue to be collected in alternation with further completions of Bank, even after Cash Held is lit.</p>

<p>Collecting a Gold award from the gold and silver target and spelling Money on the same ball lights the right loop lock shot for an extra ball.</p>

<h3>Wheel of Riches</h3>

<p>Shoot a ball into either lower saucer when Spin is lit to take a spin of the roulette wheel within the playfield itself. Wherever the ball inside stops is the award you get. Possibilities are points (10,000, 20,000, 30,000, 40,000, 50,000, 100,000), 5,000 + instant multiball, 5,000 + extra ball when flashing, and 5,000 + special when flashing. Game settings determine how often the game will flash neither, one, or both of the two extra ball spaces and the two special spaces. </p>

<p>At the beginning of the ball in play, both Spin saucers are lit. Making one of these saucers will unlight it. Rolling through an in lane lights the opposite Spin saucer for 20 seconds.</p>

<p>The Millionaire letters across the playfield track your progress toward scoring 1,000,000 points over the course of the game. (Every 90,910 points you score lights one letter.) When you spell Millionaire, the Wheel of Riches is instantly spun once. This instant spin only occurs when your score reaches 1,000,000, rather than occurring at every 1,000,000 point interval (though I am unsure if the free spin is given again at 11,000,000 since the game score rolls over at 10,000,000). <br>If you drain a ball and the bonus from that ball brings your score over 1,000,000 points, the instant spin still happens during or after the bonus countdown. Due to what is likely a bug, the score award you receive from this instant spin will be multiplied by whatever bonus multiplier is in play. This leads to the possiblity of a spin worth more than 500,000 points. I am unsure what happens if this post-drain spin tries to award you Instant Multiball.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Millionaire has a conventional in/out lane setup. In lanes score 5,000 points and a bonus advance as well as lighting the opposite saucer for a Spin. Out lanes score 20,000 points and 3 bonus advances. There are gates in both out lanes: the left gate directs the ball to the left in lane and is lit at the start of the ball or after completing Money, while the right gate directs the ball to the shooter lane and is lit after completing Bank or hitting any inline target.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is advanced by in lanes or unlit Money and Bank targets, or 3 times by out lanes. Max base bonus is 79,000 points. The two inline drop targets and the first hit to the standup target behind them increase the bonus multiplier in the order 2x-3x-5x. Max full bonus is 5x 79,000 = 395,000 points. Base bonus can be held to the next ball; see "Bank targets, gold and silver target, hold bonus" above. Bonus multipliers can never be carried from ball to ball. There is no mid-ball bonus collect. If bonus hold is qualified on the last ball of the game, the current base bonus will be collected once with the lit multiplier, and then a second time with no multipliers applied.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>In competition/novelty play, specials score 100,000 points. There does not seem to be any setting that makes extra balls have a point value.</p>

<p>The out lane gates can be set to be untimed (open until used once lit) or have a timer of 1-99 seconds. Default 5.</p>

<p>Money progress, Bank progress, Gold/Silver progress, and bonus multipliers can each be independently set to carry over from ball to ball. By default, none of them do.</p>

<p>The Spin lights can be set to both be off at the start of the ball instead of both being on.</p>

<p>There are 2 extra ball spaces and 2 special spaces on the Wheel of Riches. These spaces only award extra ball or special when flashing. Both of these features can be set to have both spaces flash every spin, or to randomly pick 1 space to flash on every spin or every 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, or 8th spin.</p>
