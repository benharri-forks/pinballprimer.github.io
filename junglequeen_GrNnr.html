<h1>Jungle Queen / Jungle Princess (1977)</h1>

<p>Jungle Queen is the 4-player version. Jungle Princess is the 2-player version. The two games have identical layouts, rules, and scoring.</p>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Always try to get the B lane on the plunge, since it's almost impossible to get any other way. Completing A-B-C awards 2x bonus and can light a special if all drop targets are cleared. Drop targets also advance bonus: clearing either bank lights the lane behind that bank for 5,000, and clearing both lights a moving extra ball. Once the drop targets are cleared, shoot for the top saucers or the side lanes for the 5,000 points. Don't rely on the mini-flippers for shotmaking, they put the ball out of control side-to-side too easily.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>All lanes score 500 points and a bonus advance. Going through a lit lane collects that letter and unlights it. Collecting all of A-B-C lights double bonus. (Double bonus is given for free on the final ball of the game.) Collecting all of A-B-C and knocking down all 10 drop targets on the same ball lights a special that rotates between the four corners of the table. A and C can also be collected on the in lanes, but it's extremely difficult to get the B at any time other than the plunge, so always aim for the B as a skill shot.</p>

<h3>Top corner saucers</h3>

<p>Saucers always score 5,000 points and kick the ball toward the opposite lower flipper. If both banks of drop targets have been completed, an extra ball will rotate between these two saucers and the two out lanes on each 10-point switch hit. If both banks of drop targets and A-B-C have all been completed, a special will rotate between these saucers and the out lanes as well.</p>

<h3>Bumpers</h3>

<p>Red bumpers always score 100 points. The blue bumper scores 10 points when not lit or 100 points when lit, and is lit only when the B has been collected.</p>

<h3>Drop targets</h3>

<p>Each target down scores 500 points and a bonus advance. Completing one bank lights the side lane behind that bank only for 5,000 points. Completing both banks lights the rotating extra ball (always) and the rotating special (if A-B-C is also complete). Drop targets never reset mid-ball, even if the banks are completed.</p>

<h3>Side lanes</h3>

<p>Score 500 points, or 5,000 when lit, and are lit when the nearby bank of drop targets has been cleared. These lanes can be shot from below, leading to a possibility of an up-and-down that scores 10,000 points; or, they can be fallen into from above, typically from a missed top saucer shot or a bounce off of a red bumper. The exits from these lanes typically send the ball toward the "upper" mini-flippers.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>The in and out lanes on Jungle Queen are in the conventional places, but in the place of a typical slingshot, there is another smaller flipper. Do not rely on these mini-flippers for shotmaking, as they are much weaker than the standard flippers and tend to add a lot of side-to-side momentum to the ball, putting it out of control more easily or at a higher risk for an out lane drain.</p>

<p>The out lanes score 5,000 points, and can be lit for an extra ball or a special as described in the Top corner saucers section. Lit extra balls and specials rotate around the table between the two out lanes and the two top saucers with every 10-point switch hit. The in lanes score 500 points and a bonus advance: the left in lane can collect the letter A, and the right in lane can collect the letter C.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Bonus is advance by the top lanes, the in lanes, and by each individual drop target. Bonus is doubled by completing A-B-C within a single ball. Double bonus is given for free on the final ball of the game. Max bonus is 2x 19,000 = 38,000 points. Bonus multipliers and base bonus count can never be carried from ball to ball. There is no mid-ball bonus collect. Bonus on Jungle Queen is usually a very significant part of scoring, unless a particularly long ball scored multiple 5,000-point saucers or side lanes.</p>
