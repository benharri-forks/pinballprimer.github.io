<h1 style="color:red;">Harlem Globetrotters: On Tour (Bally, 1979)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Complete the in lane drop targets to score 5X bonus, then repeatedly shoot the spinner that will be worth 2,000 points per spin. If extra balls are on, complete the left standup targets to light the right standup for an extra ball.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top saucer and G-L-O-B-E</h3>

<p>Scores 3,000 points, 3 bonus advances, and whichever letter in G-L-O-B-E is lit. One major setting for the game determines whether the saucer is always lit for the next letter in Globe, or whether the light will constantly switch, effectively making it random what letter is awarded.<br>G-L-O-B-E letters can also be spotted by the in line drop targets (described in more detail below).</p>

<p>Any completion of G-L-O-B-E scores 50,000 points. The first completion of G-L-O-B-E lights the out lane for 25,000 points for the rest of the game. Every completion of G-L-O-B-E starting with the second or third (depending on settings) scores a special, which is worth an additional 50,000 points during competition play.</p>

<h3>Left spinner</h3>

<p>Is worth a measly 10 points per spin at the beginning of the ball. Each in line drop target knocked down increases its value for the rest of the ball, to 100, then 200, then 1,000, and finally 2,000 points per spin. When this spinner is lit for maximum value, nothing comes close to being as valuable as a shot, it should be top priority for any ball on the right flipper.</p>

<h3>In line drops and saucer</h3>

<p>Each individual drop target scores 5,000 points and spots the next letter in G-L-O-B-E. The second, third, and fourth drop targets also light 2X, 3X, and 5X bonus, respectively. When all drop targets are down, the saucer behind them will be lit for 25,000; collecting that will light the saucer for a special, or 50,000 in competition play. <br>A setting in the game determines whether the in line drop targets reset when the saucer award is collected, or only at the end of the ball. If they don't reset mid ball, whack the ball into this saucer repeatedly from either left flipper for big value.</p>

<p>If possible, get a feel for 1) which left flipper it's easier to shoot the drops from, and 2) how dangerous the ball feed is as it comes back down after hitting a drop target.</p>

<h3>Center spinners</h3>

<p>Both spinners always score 100 points per spin. Lit spinners make progress toward bonus advance- every 5th spin of a lit spinner is worth 1 bonus advance. Depending on game settings, both spinners or just one might be lit. These spinners typically aren't worth going out of your way to aim for, but both can be hit from any flipper.</p>

<h3>Left player standups and right solo standup</h3>

<p>Each target scores 300 points. Hitting all 5 scores 10,000 points and advances the value of the far right standup. </p>

<p>The far right standup always opens the right gate if the gate is not already open. Initially, the target scores 300 points. After one completion of the left targets, the right target will be lit once for extra ball (worth 25,000 points in competition play), then subsequent hits score 5,000. After a second completion of the player targets, the right standup will be lit for special, then 5,000 again once the special is collected.<br>It's always nice to have the right gate open, and if extra balls are on it may be worth it to grab one, but the standup target strategy does not involve any bonus advance, and bonus is important enough that other strategies should generally be favored instead.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>There is no left in lane. The left out lane scores 1,000 points, or 25,000 when lit by completing G-L-O-B-E once. There are two left flippers, and it is possible to scissor drain between them. Be very careful when trying to get control of a ball coming toward the left flipper.</p>

<p>The right side is closer to a conventional setup. The in lane scores 300 points and 3 bonus advances. However, it cannot be shatzed/alley passed. The right out lane scores 1,000 points. Hitting the right solo standup target opens a gate that sends a right out lane ball back to the in lane. Going through the out lane when the gate is open scores 3,000 points and closes the gate; it must then be lit again at the right solo standup.</p>

<h3>Bonus</h3>

<p>Bonus is a huge part of Harlem Globetrotters. Take special care not to tilt. The right in lane and top saucer award 3 bonus advance; in line drop targets and 5 spins of the lit center spinner award 1 bonus advance. <br>Maximum bonus is 5x 49,000 = 245,000.</p>

<p>The game can be set to have a Super Bonus. If the bonus count ever reaches 20, 30, or 40, that number acts as a checkpoint, and all future balls will start with that amount of bonus. Whether or not this is active depends on machine settings; recommended settings in the game's manual list this feature as on for 3 ball play and off for 5 ball play.</p>

<h3>Miscellanea</h3>

<p>G-L-O-B-E letters and the number of G-L-O-B-E completions are kept track of from ball to ball. <br>Progress on the 5 left standup targets is not held from ball to ball by default, but can be as an operator setting. <br>Bonus multipliers and in line drop target progress are reset between balls.<br>Other game settings include whether the lit G-L-O-B-E letter at the top saucer is constant or automatically rotates; whether the in line drop targets reset after the saucer behind them is collected; and whether the special at the right side solo standup target can be collected only once or repeatedly with completions of the 5 left targets in between.</p>
