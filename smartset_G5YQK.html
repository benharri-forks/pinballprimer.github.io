<h1>Smart Set (Williams, 1969)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Try to keep the gate open at all times by hitting A and B at the top of the table, as well as the center post by hitting the lower side standups. If the gate is open and post is up, shoot any saucer: the top saucer is lit for 500 points after 4 hits, and the side saucers light the different colours of the wheel for 10x value.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>A and B</h3>

<p>A can be collected for 100 points at the left upper lane, or 10 points at the upper left standup. Collecting A lights the yellow bumpers for 10 points instead of 1.<br>B can be collected for 100 points at the right upper lane, or 10 points at the upper right standup. Collecting B lights the red bumpers for 10 points instead of 1.</p>

<h3>Top saucer</h3>

<p>Scores 50 points and lights the next arrow. When all arrows are lit (i.e. starting with the 5th hit), the saucer becomes worth 10x value, or 500 points per hit. </p>

<h3>Middle side standups</h3>

<p>Score 20 points and lower the center post between the flippers, if it is raised.</p>

<h3>Side saucers and big wheel</h3>

<p>The big wheel is a selection of 10 lights in the middle of the playfield. Three are yellow and read 30; two are green and read 40; two are blue and read 50; two are red and read 40; one is red and reads 20+extra ball. Which award is lit rotates on its own over time. Landing in either side saucer scores the currently lit award. If that colour is not lit already, it becomes lit; if it was lit already, 10 times as many points are awarded. If the wheel is pointing to 20+extra ball, the extra ball is instantly awarded (maximum one per ball in play).</p>

<h3>Lower side standups</h3>

<p>Raise the center post if it is currently lowered. It stays up until the end of the ball or until a Down Post target is hit.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Smart Set does not have in lanes. The flippers back directly up to the slingshots. The out lanes always score the current wheel value (including the 10x multiplier if the wheel is on a lit colour). <br>The right out lane has a gate that opens if A and B have both been collected, which sent the ball back to the shooter lane. Going through the gate closes the gate, unlights A-B, and unlights all pop bumpers.</p>

<p>There is a center post between the flippers that raises or lowers with the Up Post and Down Post targets on the sides of the table.</p>

<h3>Miscellanea</h3>

<p>Some copies of Smart Set, likely ones at the very end of the production run, have the middle and lower side targets switched, so that the middle targets raise the center post and the bottom targets lower the post, instead.</p>

<p>Reaching the replay score can be set to score a replay or instantly award an extra ball (which does nothing if extra ball has already been collected on that ball in play).</p>
