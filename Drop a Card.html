<h1 style="color:red;">Drop-a-Card (Gottlieb, 1971, EM)</h1>
<p>Not to be confused with Pop-a-Card, the 1972 add-a-ball version of this table with the same layout and slightly different rules.</p>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Complete the drop targets on either side, but don't prioritize the top bank unless you're playing in an environment that gives points for specials. After completing banks, crash into the bumpers as much as possible and hope for upper side lanes. Be mindful that tilt ends game. </p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Plunge and skill shot</h3>
<p>One of the top lanes will be lit for 100, while the other is only worth 10. If you can, practice the table and figure out how far back to pull the plunger to get either result so you can choose when you need to.<br>You may want to intentionally shoot for the unlit lane if the bumper is lit on only that side. <br>Be careful and ready to nudge away the common house ball where off the plunge the ball goes through a top lane, misses the bumper, hits the post immediately above the 5 or 6 targets, and arcs into the opposite out lane. 

<h3>Left and right drop target banks</h3>
<p>The left and right banks of drops each light the corresponding bumper for 100 points and the corresponding upper side lane for 500 points. <br> The targets themselves are worth 50 points each. <br> Shoot for these before shooting for anything else. </p>

<h3>Top drop target bank</h3>
<p>The top bank of 10-A drops lights the out lanes for 500 points each when completed. The targets themselves are also worth 50 points each. Shooting for these directly, especially the Jack, Queen, and King in the middle, can be very dangerous and give you a return SDTM.</p>

<p>If all drop targets are cleared, the upper side lanes and the out lanes are all lit red for Special. Not worth going for unless you're specifically playing under rules where specials are worth bonus points, or you're playing for fun on location and the free game means something. :)</p>
<p>Targets do not reset at any point in the game.</p>

<h3>Pop bumpers</h3>
<p>Worth 10 points per hit, or 100 points per hit when lit. Once a bumper is lit, shoot for the wall in the top corner between the bumper and the upper side lane post with the hope that the ball will bounce off the bumper a bunch, or bounce into a lit upper lane. 

<h3>Upper side lanes</h3>
<p>Worth 50 points normally, or 500 points when lit. <br> These are basically impossible to shoot for directly, so hope you can bounce into one off a bumper.<br> It's possible, but so rare that it's almost not worth mentioning, to bounce from the 5 or 6 targets across the table such that the ball goes up the return of this lane and then back down to get credit twice. It's almost impossible to do intentionally, but feels really good if you get 1,000 points out of it. <br>These lanes are lit for Special if all 13 targets in the game get knocked down.</p>

<h3>Star rollovers and bullseye standups</h3>
<p>Unlit star rollovers are worth 10, lit ones are worth 100. Every time the 100s digit of the score moves, the game switches which ones are lit and which ones aren't.<br>A slow moving ball can have its direction changed a lot by the raised star part of the rollover, so be careful.</p>
<p>There are also standup targets with bullseyes on them below the side banks of drops that follow the same scoring as the star rollovers. Don't shoot for these directly, if you're lucky the slings will bounce into them for you.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>
<p>There are no in lanes; the flippers (which are smaller, old-style 2 inch flippers) are immediately next to the slings. Trapping up on this table is very difficult since there are no in lanes and dead bounces aren't exactly trustworthy.</p>
<p>Slings award 1 point each. It's very easy to end up in slingtown such that the ball bounces back and forth 5 or 6 times before ending up out lane. Be ready on a nudge at all times.</p>
<p>The out lanes award 50 points each by default. This is increased to 500 points if the 10-Ace targets are finished, with a Special thrown in if all targets in the game are down. <br>Since tilt ends game, weigh carefully the risk and reward of nudging a ball back into play, especially if the out lanes are lit.<br>If a ball gets stuck in the 500 insert at the top of the lane, it can be nudged back into play without too much difficulty by pushing the side wall toward the ball.</p>

<h3>Tilt ends game</h3>
<p>Upward nudges can be very helpful, especially the ones around the tops of the slings by the out lane mouths. Be warned, though, that tilt ends game, so do this in moderation and don't be afraid to take time between balls to let the tilt bob settle.</p>
<p>Lazarus saves do happen on this game, especially if the ball is moving across the table slightly as it center drains. Don't walk or look away until you know the ball is gone.</p>

<h3>EM scoring</h3>
<p>The shortcomings of electromechanical scoring are sometimes on display with this game. It's possible to hit two or even three targets in the time it takes the score motor to register five hits to the 10 point reel, in which case you'll only get credit for one of the targets you hit. To truly be as efficient as possible, try to hit only one card target at a time.<br>This quirk can also rarely happen if the ball touches a 100-point star rollover while the 500 points from an upper side lane are still happening.</p>
