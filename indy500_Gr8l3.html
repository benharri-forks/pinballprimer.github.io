<h1>Indianapolis 500 (Bally Williams, 1995)</h1>



<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>The left orbit is your friend: it lights locks for multiball at the upper flipper shot, passes cars toward first place for a Victory Lap award, and lights the right orbit to start modes. If you're really good at a left orbit -> lock shot combo, consider doing that all day if possible. Repeated shots to the left ramp are the only way to change which mode is lit; try to align the 3x Playfield mode with either a multiball or the lighting of a Victory Lap. Victory Laps are lit at the center saucer by collecting 200 laps around the playfield, playing all the modes, passing all 27 drivers, or hitting the light-up targets enough times- stack multiple Victory Laps at once for massive points, which can stil be tripled.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Skill shots</h3>

<p>On the plunge, the ball will always come to the right in lane. Immediately shooting the left ramp scores the skill shot, worth 5,000,000 points the first time increasing by 1,000,000 each time to a maximum of 15,000,000. This skill shot is available on any ball plunge, whether at the beginning of a turn or after a lock is made.<br>If the plunged ball is bounced over to the left flipper and the <i>right</i> ramp is made immediately instead, Go for the Pole mode will start. This is only available if Go for the Pole has not yet been played on your current set of Speedway modes. More info on Go for the Pole and Speedway modes is given in the next section.</p>

<h3>Speedway modes</h3>

<p>There are 11 standard Speedway modes, then the 12th mode is Checkered Flag which is always played last. Shooting the left orbit will light the right orbit for a Speedway mode. A right orbit shot needs to land in the saucer in the far back of the game to count for a mode start. Modes can be stacked; Award Speedway can be lit or collected at the right orbit at any time as long as there is no multiball currently running. Modes can also be started at the center saucer, but only if nothing else is running; you can't use the center lane option to stack modes. The started mode will always be whichever one is currently flashing on the playfield. The only way to change which mode is flashing is by shooting the right ramp a certain number of times until it gives Advance Speedway- this can take just 1 or 2 ramp shots early in the game, or as many as 10 later in the game. The modes, as listed anticlockwise on the playfield starting after the finish line, are as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Go for the Pole:</i> you have 20 seconds to shoot the right ramp 4 times. Scoring: 5,000,000, then 10,000,000, then 15,000,000, then 20,000,000. Pressing the launch button during this mode will spot the next award for you one time.</li>
	<li><i>Quick Pit:</i> a Pit Stop begins. See Pit Stop Multiball later in the guide for more information. Quick Pit can only be started from the right orbit shot. If you start a mode at the center saucer when Quick Pit is flashing, you will instead receive <i>Secret Mode: Jets Give Neat Stuff</i>, where for the next trip to the pop bumpers only, each of the three bumpers will give either one Position, a bunch of Laps (15-20 or so), or 5,000,000 points.</li>
	<li><i>3x Playfield Values:</i> all scoring and all Laps are tripled for 30 seconds. Everything in the game can be tripled, including jackpots from multiball and Victory Lap scoring. For this reason, it's best to save 3x Playfield until a multiball or Victory Lap is ready if possible. If neither of these are the case, your best bet for how to use 3x Playfield is a Loop Turbo Combo (left orbit -> upper flipper) or immediately starting another mode.</li>
	<li><i>Gasoline Alley:</i> shoot the right orbit 5 times in 30 seconds. The first shot gives 5,000,000 points and 10 laps; the second gives 10,000,000 points; the third gives 15,000,000 points and instantly passes 15 cars; the fourth gives 20,000,000 points; the fifth gives 25,000,000 points. Collecting the third award of this mode is extremely important, because 15 passes is more than half of the requirement for lighting the Victory Lap for reaching 1st place, and you get it in one shot; this is the only way in the game that I know of to earn more than one Position at a time.</li>
	<li><i>Wrong Turn:</i> a 30-second frenzy mode. All switches in the game score the current Wrong Turn value, which starts at 250,000 and increases by 250,000 each time any saucer is hit (center, Turbo, or right orbit). If there is a max Wrong Turn value, it is at least 2,000,000 per switch. Putting balls up the middle into the center saucer is the way to go, since the saucer increases the switch value and then throws the ball into the pop bumpers.</li>
	<li><i>Light Extra Ball:</i> at the center saucer. Self explanatory.</li>
	<li><i>Caution:</i> the game's video mode. Use the left and right flippers to steer. Collect the squares with numbers on them, as they're worth that many million points (or an extra ball if you're lucky enough to get one that says EB), and avoid the debris. You get 1,000,000 points for each piece of debris you dodge, and the mode ends when you crash or dodge 30 pieces.</li>
	<li><i>Super Light-ups:</i> this mode is bugged and doesn't do anything, but as far as I can tell you still need to start it to complete the Speedway.</li>
	<li><i>Dueling Drivers:</i> shoot the two orbits and two ramps once each in any order within 30 seconds. Scoring: 5,000,000, then 10,000,000, then 15,000,000, then 20,000,000. Like Go for the Pole, you can press the launch button to score one of these shots for free.</li>
	<li><i>Super Jets:</i> this is an untimed opportunity that lasts until the ball drains. Hit a total of 30 bumpers to score 30,000,000 points.</li>
	<li><i>Turbo Boost:</i> a 2-ball quick multiball. Jackpot starts at 10,000,000 points and is collectible at the Turbo shot. Any shot to the left ramp increases the jackpot by 10,000,000 for about 10 seconds, up to a maximum of 90,000,000 points.</li>
	<li><i>Checkered Flag:</i> only available after playing all other Speedway modes (you do not need to complete them). All this does is light Victory Lap at the center saucer. Once that Victory Lap is collected, all mode progress resets and you can play through them all again.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Laps</h3>

<p>Any major shot in the game awards 1 Lap, except for the left ramp, which gives 2. The right ramp can also be worth 2 Laps if shot multiple times consecutively, as it will be lit for Fast Laps. Starting a Speedway mode awards 5 Laps. Laps can also be given as the first award in Gasoline Alley mode above, or Change Setup mode below. All lap awards are tripled when 3x Playfield mode is running, but the game doesn't tell you this. Collecting 200 Laps over the course of the game lights the center saucer for a Victory Lap.</p>

<h3>Position</h3>

<p>You start the race in 28th place. Shooting an unlit left orbit or either ramp lights the left orbit for Pass, which advances you one position in the race. Collecting a Hit the Wall award by completing the lower left standup targets then shooting the right orbit will also award one Position. During Jets Give Neat Stuff secret mode, the upper left bumper will give one Position per hit until the ball leaves the bumper area. Finally, the third award from Gasoline Alley is Pass 15 Drivers, which gives you 15 positions at once. If you advance all the way to 1st place in the race, the center saucer will be lit for Victory Lap. Once you reach 1st place, you'll stay there for the rest of the game, so only 1 Victory Lap can be earned from Positions per game.</p>

<h3>Souvenirs and Light-up Targets</h3>

<p>Rolling through an unlit in/out lane will light that letter in the word Indy. Lane change can be used with either flipper to rotate where the lit lanes are, but both flippers rotate the lit lanes to the right. Spell Indy to light the left ramp for a Souvenir. There are 10 Souvenirs in total. The game will tell you that each one awards more points than the previous one, but due to a bug, you will always get only 5,000,000 points. After you've collected all 10 Souvenirs, the game will still try to tell you that Souvenir is lit when you complete the Indy bottom lanes, but this isn't true as there are no Souvenirs to collect. Also, lit Souvenirs cannot be stacked, so be sure to shoot the left ramp before completing Indy again so that you don't accidentally waste your effort.</p>

<p>There are 3 "light-up" targets: one in the back of the game to the left of the center saucer, and two more immediately to the left of the right ramp. Each of these targets has 4 lights to it. To complete "waves" of these targets, you must hit each target 4 times. The value of hitting a single target is 1,000,000 points times the wave number you are currently on. Completing a single target scores 5,000,000 points. Completing all three targets finishes the Wave, which scores 15,000,000 points the first time, increasing by 5,000,000 with each subsequent Wave up to a maximum of 35,000,000 points. Completing wave 4 lights Extra Ball at the center saucer. Completing wave 6 lights the center saucer for Victory Lap. As far as I have found, you cannot light multiple Victory Laps via the Light-Up targets in a single game.</p>

<p>Collecting certain Souvenirs will make it so that only 1 hit is needed to complete each Light-Up target instead of 4.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Wave 1: T-Shirt (souvenir 1)</li>
	<li>Wave 2: Teddy Bear (souvenir 3)</li>
	<li>Wave 3: Mug (souvenir 6)</li>
	<li>Wave 4: Frisbee (souvenir 8)</li>
	<li>Wave 6: Cow (souvenir 10)</li>
</ul>
<p>I do not believe that any souvenirs help with Wave 5 or any of the waves after 7.</p>

<h3>Victory Laps</h3>

<p>Completing any one of the game's 4 major objectives- 200 laps, reaching 1st place, playing all Speedway modes, or completing Wave 6 of the light-up targets- will light the center saucer for Victory Lap. Multiple Victory Laps can be lit at the same time, if you are able to avoid shooting the center saucer until completing 2 or more different objectives. A one-way Victory Lap is worth 200,000,000 points, and a two-way Victory Lap is worth 500,000,000. According to <a href="http://tiltforums.com/t/indianapolis-500-bugs/6127">this TiltForums post</a>, a three-way Victory Lap is worth exactly 732,000,000 and a four-way Victory Lap is worth 1,000,000,000, but I have not been able to verify these numbers. Victory Lap scoring <i>CAN</i> be tripled by 3x Playfield! For this reason, if you think you are able to get to any Victory Laps, try to hold off on starting 3x Playfield until one of them is ready. </p>

<h3>Locks and regular multiball</h3>

<p>Making two lit locks at the Turbo from the upper flipper will start multiball. For the first multiball, one shot to the left orbit lights both locks. For the second multiball, one shot to the left orbit is required to light each lock. After that, it takes one more orbit shot to light each lock than for the previous multiball. The most I have seen is 4 left orbits required per lock. Depending on game settings, you may or may not be able to light lock 2 before earning lock 1.</p>

<p>When two balls are locked, a third ball is autoplunged to the playfield. To start, both ramps are lit for a Jackpot. After collecting a Jackpot, only the opposite ramp to the one you just made will be lit for the next Jackpot. Jackpots start at 30,000,000 points. Shooting the Turbo when it is not lit for Lock during single ball play will increase the jackpot by 2,000,000 points. The center saucer will also add 2,000,000 to the Jackpot value whenever it is not lit for a Green Flag mode start. The max jackpot value is 50,000,000 points. <br>Balls can be relocked at the Turbo during multiball. A relocked ball will stay there for 20 seconds before being kicked out. Relocking balls in the Turbo during multiball does a few things for you:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Each ball relocked in the Turbo will increase the regular jackpot value by 10,000,000 points until it is kicked out.</li>
	<li>If there are exactly two balls left in play, relocking both balls will add a third ball back to the playfield.</li>
	<li>Relocking 3 balls scores a Super Jackpot worth a flat 60,000,000 points, and adds a fourth ball to the playfield. If four balls are in play, all four need to be relocked to score a further Super Jackpot.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Super Jackpot isn't really worth going for on its own since its value never grows, so it's relatively common for a standard jackpot with one or two balls relocked to be worth more than the Super. If there are no balls on the playfield, any relocked balls will be immediately spit out. Multiball ends when there is only one ball on the playfield and no balls in the Turbo lock. There is no multiball restart offered, even if multiball ends without making a single jackpot of any kind.</p>

<h3>Pit Stop multiball</h3>

<p>Complete the PIT top lanes to light the right ramp for Pit Stop. Shoot the right ramp and the ball will be held in the back of the game while a second ball is kicked out. (If you start Pit Stop through the Quick Pit mode, the mode start shot will hold the ball for you.) The goal now is to shoot the right ramp with the second ball as quickly as possible to get the first ball out of the pit lane. The longer you take, the fewer shots will be lit for a Jackpot during Pit Stop multiball. If you shoot the right ramp within 12 seconds, all four ramp/orbit shots will be lit for jackpot. If you take at least 12 seconds, the left ramp will not be lit. If you take at least 18 seconds, the right orbit will not be lit. If you take at least 25 seconds, the multiball starts automatically, and the left orbit will be the only jackpot shot. If you drain the one free ball during the 25 second stopwatch, the held ball will be kicked out and the entire multiball chance is lost. Jackpots score 10,000,000 points to start, increasing by 2,000,000 each time. I am not sure what the limit is for this. Once a jackpot is collected, it will unlight, but collecting every jackpot will relight all of the shots that were lit when the multiball began.</p>

<p>One slightly cheesy way to play this mode is to intentionally time out the Pit stopwatch so that the left orbit is the only jackpot. Since there are no other jackpots that would need to be collected, the left orbit will effectively always be lit for jackpot, so you can trap a ball on the left flipper and then shoot the left orbit with the right flipper over and over again to earn increasing big points plus one Position with each shot.</p>

<h3>Wrench targets</h3>

<p>There are 4 Wrench targets around the game. Lots of people on the internet call these Spanners. I do not know why. That's not a thing. These objects are called "wrenches". Soapbox moment aside, the four  targets in question are on either side of the Turbo, just to the right of the center saucer, and in the lower right. Hit a flashing target to score 500,000 points and light it. Hit a lit target to score 250,000 points. Lighting all 4 targets spells a random word relating to the Indy 500 race or pinball. The first word completed scores 4,000,000 points, and each subsequent word scores 2,000,000 more than the previous.</p>

<h3>Change Setup</h3>

<p>This is a choose-your-own-award that is available at the right orbit. The first Change Setup requires one shot to the blue post target on the left side of the left ramp entrance. Subsequent Change Setups each need one more hit to this target. When Change Setup starts, you have 5 seconds to pick the award you want. Press either flipper button to change the award, but you can't go back once you've pressed the button. Possible awards are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Big Points: 1,000,000, 5,000,000, 10,000,000, 15,000,000, or 20,000,000</li>
	<li>Small Points: 20, 50, 70, or 100</li>
	<li>Spot PIT lane</li>
	<li>Light Change Setup</li>
	<li>Light Lock</li>
	<li>Laps: 5 or 10</li>
	<li>Light Extra Ball</li>
</ul>

<h3>Hit the Wall</h3>

<p>Hit all three standup targets in the lower left of the playfield to light the right orbit for Hit the Wall. The next right orbit shot that lands in the mode start saucer scores Hit the Wall, which is worth 5,000,000 the first time increases by 2,000,000 each subsequent time. If there is a maximum, it is at least 11,000,000. Collecting a Hit the Wall also awards one Position.</p>

<h3>Loop-Turbo Combo</h3>

<p>A left orbit -> Turbo combo is worth 10,000,000 points the first time and increases by 2,000,000 each time one is made. The max is supposedly 30,000,000 points. I feel like I have faint memory of seeing this combo increase by 3,000,000 instead of 2,000,000, and also that it exceeded 30,000,000...but there may have been a 3x Playfield running and I just didn't realize. More testing required.<br>Regardless, this is a very difficult maneuver that can be worth a whole lot of points. Balls often come around the left orbit very fast, so to reflex the ball into the Turbo, you may need to start pressing the flipper button before the ball is even touching the flipper itself. This is worth getting good at, if you can.</p>

<h3>Right ramp</h3>

<p>In addition to other scoring features listed above, the right ramp lights extra balls at 8 and 60 shots. Making a right ramp at any time scores 1 Lap and lights itself for Fast Laps for a few seconds, where further shots score 2 Laps instead of 1. At various ramp counts, the right ramp will "advance Speedway", which is the only way to change which mode is flashing as the next one to be started.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Indianapolis 500 has a conventional in/out lane setup. The in/out lanes spell Indy as described in the "Souvenirs and Light-up Targets" section above. There is no kickback, drain save, or center peg.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>The main component of end of ball bonus is simply a count of switch hits, whose distribution is almost impossible to calculate. However, you also get 10,000 points per Lap collected (which can go over 200 if you get the Victory Lap for 200 Laps), plus a Position Bonus that starts at 250,000 and increases by 50,000 for each Position you've earned. Everything so far is multiplied by the bonus multiplier, which is increased one by one to a maximum of 8x by completing the PIT top lanes. Finally, you receive scoring from Dueling Drivers, Gasoline Alley, and/or Wrong Turn if you played any of them on that ball. A long ball can easily have bonus upwards of 100,000,000 with just a couple multipliers. Take care not to tilt if you played some modes or had a long multiball. There is no mid-ball bonus collect, and there is no holdover for bonus multiplier or the switch hits portion of base bonus.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>The game manual lists that specials score 30,000,000 points in competition/novelty play, but I don't know of anywhere in the game that a special can be directly awarded. There is no way to set extra balls to a point value, so the Light Extra Ball mode and Change Setup award are worthless in a tournament setting.</p>

<p>The first right ramp extra ball can be lit at anywhere from 2 to 15 shots. The second right ramp extra ball will always be either 60 ramps or disabled.</p>

<p>The game may be set to autoplunge the next ball after a lock is made. Watch carefully.</p>

<p>The Pit Stop can last anywhere from 15 to 45 seconds (default 25). I am not sure how this affects the exact thresholds for how many jackpots are lit.</p>

<p>3x Playfield, Wrong Turn, Go for the Pole, Gasoline Alley, and Dueling Drivers modes can all have their mode time changed to anywhere from 15-45 seconds, independently from one another. In the same vein, Change Setup can last anywhere from 3 to 8 seconds.</p>
