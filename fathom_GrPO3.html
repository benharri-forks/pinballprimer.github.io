<h1>Fathom (Bally, 1981)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Light the spinner at the right standup target. Start multiball by locking a ball in either saucer, then completing the in line drop targets that appear in front of the saucer. Rip the spinner for 10,000 or 15,000 a spin during double or triple scoring in multiball. Watch out for the reversed in/out lane setup.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>A-B-C lanes</h3>

<p>The ball will end up here on the plunge, after a spinner shot, or after a shot to the blue saucer that does not make it all the way around. Any lane scores 1,000 points, and lights the letter in A-B-C if not already lit. Lit letters can be rotated with lane change on the right flipper only. The A lane advances blue bonus; the C lane advances green bonus; the B lane advances both.</p>

<p>There are multiple awards for completing A-B-C repeatedly on a ball:</p>
<ul>
	<li>1st time: lights one in lane for 50,000 points.</li>
	<li>2nd time: lights both in lanes for 50,000 points.</li>
	<li>3rd time: lights one out lane for Special.</li>
	<li>5th time: scores Special directly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Special is worth 50,000 points in competition play.</p>

<h3>Spinner, center drop targets, and right standup target</h3>

<p>The spinner is worth 500 points per spin. Hitting the right standup target at any time lights the spinner for 5,000 points per spin for the rest of the ball.</p>

<p>If the center drop targets are completed in order of 1-2-3, the lit bonus (blue or green) will receive 5 advances, and the right standup target will be lit for extra ball for 6-10 seconds, depending on settings. In competition play, extra ball scores 25,000 points.</p>

<p>In addition to the above features, the right standup and each center drop score 1 bonus advance of whichever colour is lit in front of them. The coloured light switches between blue and green on bumper or slingshot hits.</p>

<h3>Lock lanes and multiball</h3>

<p>The green lane goes up the right side of the playfield and can be shot from the left flipper. The blue lane starts midway up the playfield on the left side and curves around the top: it can be shot with either right flipper, but the upper one is usually easier.</p>

<p>If there is not a ball locked in one lane's saucer, the drop targets will be down. Shooting that saucer will lock a ball. </p>

<p>If there is a ball locked in a saucer, the drop targets will be up. <br>The front in line drop target scores 10,000 points, 1 bonus advance of its colour, and lights that colour's 3X bonus. <br>The middle in line drop scores 20,000 points, 2 bonus advance for that colour, and lights that colour's 4X bonus. <br>The back in line target scores 30,000 points, 3 bonus advance for its colour, lights 5X bonus for that colour, and releases the locked ball for multiball. </p>

<p>Releasing the first lock starts 2-ball multiball. If the other lock is released during that multiball, the third ball comes into play. <br>All playfield scoring is doubled when 2 balls are in play, and tripled when 3 balls are in play; lights in the playfield will flash to denote this.<br>The best sources of scoring in multiball are the lit spinner (10,000 or 15,000 per spin is colossal; one good shot can score 200,000 points or more) or going through in lanes that were previously lit with A-B-C completions for 100,000 or 150,000 points.</p>

<p>The 6-bank of targets on the left alternates green and blue targets. Each individual target scores 1 advance of that colour's bonus. If a ball is locked in either lane and one or more in line targets is up, hitting all three targets of its colour in this bank will spot the next in line and all the associated awards. This can even start multiball if there is one in line target left, and if this is the case, a blue or green light will flash in front of the bank.</p>

<p>During multiball, take care not to shoot the balls back into the locks. There's no scoring bonus for doing so; the balls will need to be released again via another completion of the in line drops; and locking a ball will also lower the playfield multiplier or end multiball altogether since the locked ball is no longer considered in play.</p>

<p>Locked balls and the status of the in line drops always persists from player to player. You may be able to walk up to the game and instantly get a 5X bonus and a multiball from a single shot. The machine can also be set to hold onto locks between games (although I believe in this case, a new game will reset the in line drops so all 3 are up at the start of the game).</p>

<p>The star rollovers immediately next to the lock saucers always score 50,000 points. The star rollovers in the curved part of the lane that leads to the blue lock score 1,000 points. Star rollovers do not advance bonus.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>This game has two completely separate bonuses that are built up individually and have their own multipliers. Each colour bonus maxes out at 55,000 points. If multiple of the 1-10 lights are lit, the bonus count is the sum of those lit lights.</p>

<p>Blue bonus is advanced by the A and B lanes, the blue side drop targets, the left in lane, the right out lane, and the blue in line drops (which give 1, then 2, then 3 bonus). <br>Green bonus is advanced by the B and C lanes, the green left drop targets, the left out lane, the right in lane, and the green in line drops (which also give 1, then 2, then 3 advances). </p>

<p>The center 1-2-3 targets and right standup target give 1 bonus advance of the lit colour. The lit colour changes on bumper and slingshot hits. Completing the 1-2-3 targets in order scores an additional 5 advances of the lit colour.</p>

<p>Out of each in line drop set, the front target immediately awards 3X, the middle awards 4X, and the back awards 5X. If on a new ball only the back target is up to start, hitting that target instantly jumps the multiplier to 5X.</p>

<p>Max bonus for each colour is 5x 55,000 = 275,000 points. Bonus multipliers never carry over from ball to ball. Bonus count for a colour only carries over from ball to ball once it has been maxed out at 55,000. If both bonuses are maxed out at 55,000, that ball's end of ball bonus will also include a special (which I believe can only be earned once per game).</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>In lanes and out lanes are reversed from a conventional setup on both sides. The lane closer to the edge of the table is actually the in lane. It curves inward and sends the ball over a gap and through a one way gate to the flipper. The lanes closer to the flippers are actually the out lanes and go straight down towards the out hole. </p>

<p>Always be on guard whenever the ball heads toward this area at all. A ball going through the outside lane can do so slowly, choke up at the mini jump, and fall down anyway, even though it went through the "in" lane. Conversely, a ball going through the inner straight down lane may be able to be nudged back into play off of the corner post that would form the beginning of the jump. Be on alert regardless. </p>

<p>One completion of A-B-C lights one of the in lanes for 50,000. A second completion will light the other in lane as well. A third completion of A-B-C lights one of the out lanes for special. When just one in lane or just one out lane is lit, the side it is lit on will alternate with bumper or slingshot hits.</p>

<h3>Miscellanea and additional settings</h3>

<p>Special can be set to award a replay, an extra ball, or 50,000 points. Extra ball can be set to award an extra ball or 25,000 points. There is a maximum of one extra ball per ball in play; if special is set to extra ball, scoring a second is worth 50,000, and if multiple extra balls are collected, the second is worth 25,000.</p>

<p>The bonus special feature, which awards a special one per game for maxing out the bonus, can be set to be awarded when just one colour bonus reaches maximum value, rather than both.</p>

<p>The A-B-C lanes can be set to only award a special one time, on the 5th completion; or, they can be set to award a special every other completion starting with the 5th (7th, 9th, etc).</p>

<p>The bonus count for each colour can be set to carry over from ball to ball even if the max of 55,000 is not achieved. By default, this does not occur.</p>
