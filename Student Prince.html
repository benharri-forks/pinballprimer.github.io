<h1 style="color:goldenrod;">Student Prince (Williams, 1968)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>On the plunge, try for the center lane to open the gate. Hit the side standup targets to close the flippers and light the center target for 100 times the displayed number, then try to never hit those targets again or the flippers will open and the center target will lose its value. Light all 5 numbers from the top lanes or center target to immediately earn an extra ball and alternately light the out lanes.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top rollover button</h3>

<p>Collects the number indicated on the center target and scores the target value (10 or 100 times the displayed number).</p>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>Score 100 points and collect the labelled number of 1-2-3-4-5. Collecting 1, 2, 4, or 5 lights the first, second, third, or fourth bumper from the left respectively. The center 3 lane opens the gate in the top right of the game for a replunge. </p>

<h3>Upper left standup target</h3>

<p>Scores 100 points and opens the gate. Can actually be shot directly by aiming for the rubber wall just to the left of the far left bumper.</p>

<h3>Upper right gate</h3>

<p>When not lit, the gate is firm and won't let the ball through. When lit, going through the gate scores 300 points, puts the ball back in the shooter lane for a replunge, and unlights the gate itself. The gate can only be lit via the center top lane and upper left standup target.</p>

<h3>Pop bumpers</h3>

<p>Score 1 point each, or 10 points when lit. Collecting the 1, 2, 4, or 5 lights the respective bumper from left to right. </p>

<h3>Side standup targets</h3>

<p>These targets always score 10 points. At the start of the ball, and whenever the flippers are open, these targets will be lit green for Closes Flippers: hitting the target will zip the flippers together, preventing a center drain until one of the side standup targets is hit again, or until the ball drains. If the flippers are zipped together, these targets will be lit red, and hitting either one will reopen them.</p>

<h3>Center target with number wheel</h3>

<p>Any 1-point switch in the game will rotate the number wheel, causing it to display a different number between 1 and 5. Hitting this target collects the displayed number and scores 10 points times the displayed number. If the flippers are closed, the score award is 100 points times the displayed number instead. <br>When the flippers are closed, the ball can come to rest "between" them, supported by the tips. Hitting both flippers at once will send the ball straight up and hopefully hit this target for big hundreds. Just be sure to let the flippers go after making this shot so that you don't embarrassingly center drain while the flippers are zipped together.</p>

<h3>1-5 rollover buttons</h3>

<p>Each one scores 1 point, or 10 points when lit. They are lit by collecting the respective 1-5 number. Collecting all five numbers immediately awards an extra ball and lights the out lanes alternately for 300 points instead of 100.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Student Prince has no in lanes. The flippers back up to the slingshots directly, and the slingshots are larger than typical as a result. The slingshots always score 1 point. The out lanes score 100 points, or are lit alternately for 300 once 1-2-3-4-5 has been completed.</p>

<p>This game has what are known as Zipper Flippers. By hitting a side standup target when it is lit for Closes Flippers, the flippers will rotate slightly and move inward toward each other, forming a horizontal barrier that prevents a center drain. The flipper can still be used normally in this position, but due to how they are rotated, it's a bit more difficult to line up a shot, and backhand shots are far easier than expected. Still, though, the added safety is nice, so try not to reopen the flippers once they are closed. </p>

<h3>Bonus?</h3>

<p>There is no end of ball bonus, no matter how many 1-5 numbers were lit.</p>
