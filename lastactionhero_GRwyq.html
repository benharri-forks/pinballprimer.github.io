<h1 style="text-align:center">Last Action Hero (Data East, 1993)</h1>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>The greatest single source of points in the game is the LAH 6-Ball mini-wizard mode. Shooting the left ramp lights the center scoop for a Dynamite Feature; LAH 6-Ball starts after collecting the three features corresponding to the words Last, Action, and Hero. The other main route to scoring is to play the multiball sequence; hitting either captive ball enough times lights the center scoop for M-Ball. M-Ball is always at least 3 balls, but you can start with more balls and higher jackpots by completing the Crane drop targets on the left then shooting the Crane lane to lock balls first.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Skill shot</h3>

<p>The skill shot is purely timing based, and very similar to the skill shots on Lethal Weapon 3 (Data East, 1992) and Terminator 2: Judgment Day (Bally Williams, 1991). One of the five Crane targets will be lit, and the light will move back and forth. Time your press of the launch button so that the plunged ball hits whichever target is lit. Successful skill shot scores 2,000,000 points on ball 1, 3,000,000 on ball 2, and 4,000,000 on ball 3. Failed skill shots score 1/10 of the successful skill shot award. I am unsure how the skill shot scoring changes in a 5-ball game.</p>

<h3>Dynamite Features, including LAH 6-Ball mini-wizard mode and World Premiere wizard mode</h3>

<p>Dynamite Features are this game's modes, and are started when the center scoop (labelled M-Ball in front of it, because regular multiball is also started here) is lit with a yellow light above it. Shooting the left ramp lights the scoop solidly. Making either in lane lights the scoop very temporarily (only about 2 seconds). In general, Dynamite Feature modes can be stacked, but the mode start scoop will never light yellow if any multiball is running, regardless of whether it's a Feature multiball or part of the M-Ball sequence. The center scoop will be lit for a mode start for free at the start of each ball. If the center scoop is lit to start M-Ball, you cannot start a Dynamite Feature mode in any way.</p>

<p>With the exception of Light Extra Ball, all modes have a completion criterium that affects the value of LAH 6-Ball mini-wizard mode and World Premiere wizard mode. These will be listed alongside each mode. During most Dynamite Features, making the left in lane then shooting the lower right scoop within about 5 seconds will score Wildcard, which doubles all scoring for that mode. In any mode with a timer, the left captive ball will reset the mode timer back to 20 seconds one time. The modes are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The Ripper's Downtown Blow Out:</i> a 20-second single ball frenzy mode. All switches score 250,000 points. Every 10 switches hit increases the per-switch value by 50,000, with no limit that I've ever encountered. You also get 6,000,000 points just for starting the mode. This is usually worth between 15,000,000 and 20,000,000 points, but with the Wildcard doubler or by starting this mode and then one of the multiball modes, it can be much more. To complete the mode, you must score at least 20,000,000 points.</li>
	<li><i>Light Extra Ball:</i> at the lower right scoop. Stays lit until collected, even across multiple balls.</li>
	<li><i>Go to the Movies:</i> an add-a-ball round. For 20 seconds, hitting either captive ball adds one ball to the playfield, up to a maximum of 5 balls in play. The left captive ball will still reset this timer the first time it is hit. After the 20 seconds is up, the mode will last for as long as there is more than one ball in play, and captive balls will be worth 5,000,000 points each. The mode ends whenever there is only 1 ball in play after the initial 20-second timer has expired. To complete the mode, you must hit both captive balls at least once each after the 20-second timer expires.</li>
	<li><i>Cat Millions:</i> a 20-second mode. The numbers 5-6-7-8-9-10-9-8-7-6-5 appear on the display, and a small mouse bounces on the numbers. Whichever number the mouse is standing on is the value of the Cat target, in millions. The Cat target is a post target separating the left ramp from the Crane lane. After each of the first two hits, another mouse will appear to bounce on the numbers, and the target value will be the sum of all highlighted number(s). To complete this mode, hit the Cat target three times.</li>
	<li><i>Catch the Red Eye:</i> a 20-second round. Hit any of the three Eyeball targets in the mid-right of the playfield to complete. Scoring: 5,000,000, then 10,000,000, then 15,000,000.</li>
	<li><i>Big Mistake:</i> another 20-second round. Hit any drop target, then any Eyeball target, then the center mode start scoop to complete. Scoring: 5,000,000, then 10,000,000, then 15,000,000.</li>
	<li><i>Save Danny:</i> a hurry-up that starts at 20,000,000 points, counts down to 3,000,000 over about 20 seconds, and is collected at the Crane lane. A full shot to the Crane lane that lands in the back right scoop is required. Succeed to finish the mode.</li>
	<li><i>To The Roof:</i> a 20-second round. Shoot the left ramp three times to complete. Scoring: 5,000,000, then 10,000,000, then 15,000,000.</li>
	<li><i>Find Benedict:</i> a 20-second mode. Benedict is hiding in one of the game's three scoops: the mode start scoop, the Chicken scoop, or the lower right scoop. Which one he is hiding in is random; it will not always be the last one you try. Find Benedict to score 30,000,000 points and complete the mode.</li>
	<li><i>Super Crane:</i> a 6-ball quick multiball. The Crane lane is lit for 20 seconds. The first shot to the Crane scores 5,000,000 points; subsequent shots each score 5,000,000 more than the previous, with no limit that I have ever encountered. After the 20 seconds is up, you must relight the Crane lane for the next award by completing the Crane targets, which reset if you take too long to complete them or if you hit the Danger Bar behind an already knocked down target. To complete the mode, you must earn one Crane award after the timer expires.</li>
	<li><i>Last Action Hero:</i> Collecting one of the words in Last, Action, Hero scores 10,000,000 points. Collecting all three starts the LAH 6-Ball mini-wizard mode, regardless of how many Feature modes you have played. When LAH 6-Ball starts, you earn the Last Action Hero Bonus, which I believe is equal to 20,000,000 points plus an additional 5,000,000 for every mode completed so far. Then, you have 25 seconds to hit a total of 50 switches anywhere in the game to score an award that starts at 10,000,000 points. All switches add to the award by a small amount, usually 50,000-250,000 points. If you succeed, 8 seconds will be added to the clock, but the award will stay where it is and can be built up further. This mode lasts for as long as you keep hitting enough switches to extend the timer before it expires. Shooting the spinner to get credit for spins and pop bumper hits is the best way to go. If you survive long enough to increase the award past 99,999,990 points, it will overflow back to 0 and continue building from there, due to a harmless overflow bug. If you are so fast at this mode that the timer exceeds 99 seconds, it will overflow back to 0 and end the mode due to a slightly more harmful overflow bug, but this is almost impossible to have happen without a fault in the machine. A strong LAH 6-Ball round can be worth well over 1,000,000,000 points. There is unlimited ball save for as long as there is time left on the clock during LAH 6-Ball. When time expires, all balls will be allowed to drain, then one single ball will be autoplunged back to the playfield for standard play to resume.</li>
</ul>
<p>After playing all 10 regular modes as well as LAH 6-Ball, the next mode available at the scoop will be World Premiere wizard mode, which is extremely underwhelming as a finale compared to LAH 6-Ball. The display will count up from 1 to 20 over about 20 seconds. Shoot the mode start scoop to score the currently displayed number in millions of points. Do this as many times as you can. That's really it... After time expires, normal play resumes and all mode progress resets for you to make another lap through the game.</p>

<p>If the lower right scoop is not lit for anything else, shooting it when no mode or multiball is running will change the currently flashing mode to one of the words in Last Action Hero that you still need, to help make progress toward LAH 6-Ball. Otherwise, only the pop bumpers change the flashing mode, which is the one that will be started with the next shot to the lit center scoop.</p>

<h3>Locks and multiball</h3>

<p>Hitting either captive ball a certain number of times lights the mode start scoop for M-Ball. The number of hits required is 8 for the first multiball and increases by 4 for each subsequent multiball. You can score 2 hits toward M-Ball with a single shot by hitting a captive ball within about 2 seconds of rolling through an in lane. You can also score 4 hits toward M-Ball with a single shot by making a Crane lane -> ramp -> ramp -> right captive ball 4-way combo. The captive balls cannot be used to advance toward M-Ball if Go to the Movies is running.</p>

<p>M-Ball always starts with at least 3 balls: one that you put in the center saucer when M-Ball start is lit, and two more that get autoplunged to the playfield. However, two more balls can be added to the M-Ball start for a total of 5 by making Crane locks first, which there are two ways to do. The first, which is simpler to explain but harder, is to loop the Crane lane 5 consecutive times. The second, which occurs more often, requires completing the Crane drop targets on the left. However, taking too long to complete the drop targets or hitting the black and yellow "danger bar" behind the targets will reset the entire bank. When the bank is completed, a 10,000,000 point hurry-up collectible at the Crane lane will start, and the Crane lane will also be lit for a lock. Depending on game settings, the Crane lock may or may not stay lit if the hurry-up times out. Up to two balls can be locked in the Crane. In a multiplayer game, or if the Crane is disabled due to being out of order, Crane locks will be virtual and added to the playfield alongside the two free autoplunged balls. Completing the Crane drop targets when two Crane locks have been made scores 7,000,000 points.</p>

<p>M-Ball starts with a jackpot of 15,000,000, 20,000,000, or 25,000,000 depending on if zero, one, or two balls were locked in the Crane. All switches in the game add to the jackpot, usually between 50,000 and 250,000 at a time. Jackpot 1 is collected at the ramp. If Jackpot 1 is not lit to start, shoot the Crane lane to light it. Jackpot 2 is a double jackpot that must be collected at the Crane lane within 10 seconds of scoring Jackpot 1. If you do not collect Jackpot 2 in time, you must recollect Jackpot 1 for another chance. Collecting Jackpot 2 instantly upgrades the M-Ball into 6-Ball.</p>

<p>When 6-Ball starts, balls are plunged to the playfield until all 6 are in play. From now, there is no ball save and no add-a-ball in any form, so you're on your own. The goal of 6-Ball is to make it through this sequence as many times as possible before returning to single ball play:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Shoot the four Badges (left captive ball, Crane lane, Ripper lane, lower right scoop) for 5,000,000 each</li>
	<li>Shoot the Crane lane for a 30,000,000 point jackpot</li>
	<li>Shoot the four Badges again</li>
	<li>Shoot the Ramp for a Super Jackpot worth 50,000,000 points times the number of balls still in play</li>
	<li>Within 10 seconds of collecting the Super Jackpot, shoot the Crane lane for a Super Double Jackpot, worth 100,000,000 points times the number of balls in play. Regardless of whether this is collected or timed out, the 6-Ball sequence resets back to step 1.</li>
</ol>
<p>If M-Ball ends without Jackpot 1 being collected even a single time, the mode start scoop will be lit for M-Ball Restart for 10 seconds. Restarting M-Ball in this way means you only get 2 balls total, and the starting jackpot value is only 10,000,000 points, but can still work toward 6-Ball at the normal value by making Jackpots 1 and 2 in the same way.</p>

<h3>Chicken Scoop (for the soul)</h3>

<p>The center-right saucer labelled Chicken scores a Chicken advance if you shoot it directly (does not count if the ball trickles in from the pop bumper area). Two Chicken scoops scores 5,000,000 points. Three further Chicken scoops scores 10,000,000 points or extra ball depending on game settings. Four scoops after that scores 15,000,000 points or lights the out lanes for special depending on game settings. All chicken scoop awards after the third require 6 scoop shots and score 15,000,000 points.</p>

<h3>Ripper lane</h3>

<p>The Ripper is a narrow lane between the Chicken scoop and the right captive ball. Shooting this lane will launch the ball back at the flippers at an incredibly high speed, similar to the Yagov left kicker on F-14 Tomcat (Williams, 1987). A very short ball save is active in case the return sends the ball straight between the flippers. The Ripper jackpot starts at 7,500,000 points and increases by 500,000 each time the Ripper is hit; this is a progressive jackpot that builds across players, balls, and games. Collecting 6 Rippers in one game to spell Ripper as soon on the left side of the apron near where you put your left hand scores the Ripper bonus and resets it back to 7,500,000.</p>

<h3>Second Cousin Frank</h3>

<p>Another carryover award that starts at 3,000,000 points. Shooting the ramp when not lit for anything else adds 100,000 to the value. The secret passage switch that comes down from the pop bumpers between the Chicken scoop and the Ripper lane adds 250,000 to the value. Collect the value by shooting two consecutive ramp shots, immediately followed by the Chicken scoop, with nothing in between. The second ramp shot will divert the ball to the left flipper instead of the right to assist with a shot to the Chicken scoop.</p>

<h3>Eyeball targets</h3>

<p>Hit all three targets to score Benedict's Bonus Boost (all switches now contribute 20,000 to the end of ball bonus for the rest of the ball instead of 10,000) and light one of the four Badge shots around the game for 5,000,000 points one time.</p>

<h3>Spinner</h3>

<p>The spinner always scores 50,000 points per spin by default. Every 5 times a ramp -> ramp combo is scored, the spinner will be lit as Super Spinner, where each spin is worth 1,000,000 for a single shot.</p>

<h3>Smart Missile</h3>

<p>Smart Missile is triggered by a hutton on the cabinet just above the gun trigger ball plunger. It can be used once per game, and will award everything currently lit on the table. It can be used as one shot of credit for most modes, instantly award a jackpot in multiball, or instantly light M-Ball if there is not currently any multiball running. Smart Missile can be used at any time unless the game thinks that the only ball on the playfield is currently in an out lane.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Last Action Hero has a conventional in/out lane setup. Out lanes can be lit for Special by the third Chicken award. In lanes temporarily light the captive balls for 2 advances toward M-Ball, and also temporarily light the center scoop to start a mode if it is not already lit. Both temporary opportunities are only there for about 2-3 seconds before they unlight.</p>

<p>This game does recognize death saves. If the ball goes down an out lane but is then *somehow* returned to play, 3,000,000 points are scored with a slightly spooky sound effect. It's not too difficult to bang back or death save compared to other games of the era, if you know how to. <b>Remember that this is a very illegal technique in tournaments.</b></p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>Base bonus starts at 1,000,000 points. Any switch hit anywhere in the game adds 10,000 points to the bonus. If the three Eyeball targets have been completed, each switch hit will add 20,000 instead. Completing the three top lanes, which can only be accessed via pop bumper luck or a weak shot to the Crane lane, will double the entire current bonus as it stands. There is no limit to the number of times the bonus can be doubled, but the bonus maxes out at 50,000,000 points. Competing the top lanes when the bonus is maxed out scores 10,000,000 points directly. There is no bonus holdover, bonus multiplier, or mid-ball bonus collect.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>I could not find any information about possible point values for extra balls and specials in competition/novelty play. I also do not know if the game has a tournament mode that equalizes the value of the Ripper or Second Cousin Frank carryover awards, either.</p>

<p>The game can require that a value be collected from the Crane Hurry-up in order for the Crane lock to count.</p>

<p>The game can require a shot to the Crane lane during M-Ball before Jackpot 1 is lit at the left ramp.</p>
