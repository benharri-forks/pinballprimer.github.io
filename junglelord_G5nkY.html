<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Stay on the upper playfield as long as you can and hit drop targets for 10,000 points and a bonus advance each. After clearing 5 sets (1st set is 1 target, 2nd set is 2 targets, etc) the drop targets will be advanced to Double Trouble mode, where hitting one target at a time socres a doubling value of up to 160,000 points. After going through either in lane on the lower playfield, shoot the left loop to advance bonus multiplier. If you happen to collect four of the five 1-2-3-4-5 lights, aim to complete the set to earn 2x playfield scoring for the rest of the ball. Multiball is ignorable.</p>

<br>

<h2>Upper playfield</h2>

<h3>Drop targets</h3>

<p>There are two phases to drop target progression on this table. All progression as carried from ball to ball for each player. Each drop target down always gives 1 bonus advance in addition to the scoring listed below.</p>

<p><b>Phase 1:</b> you'll need to complete the bank 5 times. The first completion has one target (#3); the second has two targets (#2, #4); the third has three targets (#1, #3, #5), the fourth has 4 targets (#1-2-4-5), and the fifth has all five targets. All targets score 10,000 points. Which completion you are on, and how many targets were left in that completion, is preserved from ball to ball.</p>

<p><b>Phase 2:</b> the Double Trouble phase. One target will be raised; hitting it scores 10,000 points, starts a timer, and raises one other drop target. Hitting that second drop target scores 20,000 points and raises a different single drop target. This can be done 3 more times, for 40,000, then 80,000, then 160,000 points. The more a target is worth, the less time you get to hit that target. If time runs out, Phase 2 resets, and one target will pop up to score 10,000 points and start Double Trouble over.</p>

<h3>Saucers: Lord mini playfield and multiball</h3>

<p>There are two saucers: one in the upper right of the upper playfield, and one at the top of the right ramp. Landing in a saucer scores 1,000 points and autofires the tiny ball in the mini Lord playfield. The goal is for the tiny ball to go through a lane that is not lit yet, because doing so lights that Lord letter and lighting all four letters starts multiball, but it's basically luck based where the tiny ball goes, and even nudging isn't that helpful. All lanes in the mini playfield score 5,000 points; from left to right, they give, 4, 3, 2, and 1 bonus advance. </p>

<p>If a trip to the saucer leads to the fourth Lord letter being collected at the mini playfield, multiball will start immediately. If the fourth and final Lord letter is spotted by one of the drop target banks, multiball will start as soon as one of the upper playfield saucers is made. <br> When multiball starts, a 35 second timer will be initiated, and a second ball is fed to the shooter lane. The timer beings to count down as soon as the second ball enters the playfield. If one of the two balls drains, you will not get it back, whether the timer is still going or not; however, if you drain both balls before the timer expires, there is unlimited ball save for 1 ball during the duration of the clock. If there is only one ball in play and that ball enters one of the two upper playfield saucers, the two-ball multiball will restart, but the timer will be kept where it is. Entering a saucer still autoplunges the tiny ball in the mini playfield; if you spell Lord in the mini playfield before the 35-second clock runs out, you earn an instant Special. There are no other multiball-specific scoring rules.</p>

<h2>Lower playfield</h2>

<h3>Left loop</h3>

<p>The left loop can be traversed in either direction. The center entrance is easier to shoot than the far left entrance. Going through either in lane lights the center entrance briefly for a bonus multiplier; just how long the entrance stays lit depends on what your current bonus multiplier is, being a shorter time limit at 3x or 5x bonus than at 1x or 2x. If the bonus multiplier is maxed out at 10x, going through an in lane than using the center entrance of the loop will light one of the out lanes for Drain Save. Going through the left loop via the far left entrance at any time also lights an out lane for Drain Save.</p>

<h3>Drop targets</h3>

<p>Each drop target down scores 1,000 points and a bonus advance, as well as 1 second of time for the magna save on that side of the playfield (max 5 seconds each side). When any one drop target is hit down, a timer will begin for that bank. The other two targets in the bank must also be knocked down before the timer expires or the entire bank will reset. Completing a bank within the time limit spots one of the letters in the word Lord on the mini-playfield. The more letters in Lord are currently lit, the shorter the drop target timer is.</p>

<h3>1-2-3-4-5 and 2x scoring</h3>

<p>There are 5 numbers to light around the playfield: 1 is on the left of the upper playfield, 2 is near the center entrance of the left loop, 3 is near the right ramp, and 4 and 5 are the in lanes. Lighting all 5 numbers activates Double Scoring for the rest of the ball. Double scoring affects everything in the game: single ball play, multiball play, mini playfield, and even doubles the end of ball bonus on top of the earned bonus multiplier. Double Scoring does not mean you get twice as many bonus advances from drop targets or Lord lanes, however.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Jungle Lord has a conventional in/out lane setup. Out lanes score 5,000 points and 2 bonus advances. In lanes score 1,000 points and 1 bonus advance.<br>Both in lanes light the center entrance of the left loop for bonus multiplier advance. Bonus multiplier is progressed in the sequence 2x-3x-5x-10x. The center entrance will be lit for Drain Shield by either in lane if bonux multiplier is already 10x. The left in lane only lights the right ramp for 2 Lord Chances for about 5 seconds. The left and right in lanes score the 4 and 5 in 1-2-3-4-5 respectively.<br>One or both out lanes can be lit for Drain Shield by the left loop as previously mentioned. If only one out lane is lit, it will alternate with each slingshot hit. Lit Drain Shields stay in memory from ball to ball until they are used. When the ball drains through an out lane lit for Drain Shield, that out lane will be unlit and the ball will be given back to the shooter lane.</p>

<p>There is a magna-save above both in lanes. Initially, no magna save credit is available on either side; hitting a left or right lower drop target adds 1 second to the magna-save timer on its respective side. Use the second button behind the flipper button to activate magna-save. This can be used to change a ball's direction or, with enough charge, stop the ball directly above the in lane to lit it fall through. When you let go of the magna-save button, the currently flashing charge for the magna-save unlights; this means that, for example, holding the magna-save button for 1.1 seconds or holding it for 2 seconds will both get rid of 2 charges as shown on the playfield.</p>

<h3>Bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>All drop targets in the game award 1 bonus advance. Out lanes give 2 bonus advance. Lanes in the Lord mini-playfield give 1, 2, 3, or 4 bonus advance as labelled. Max base bonus is 39,000 points. Bonus multiplier can be advanced in the sequence 2x-3x-5x-10x by shooting the center entrance of the left loop immediately after making an in lane. Completing 1-2-3-4-5 on a ball, which doubles all scoring, will also double the end of ball bonus, compounding with the regular bonus multiplier. Thus, max bonus is 2x 10x 39,000 = 780,000 points. Bonus tends not to be valuable compared to the upper playfield drop targets unless you happen to get at least 5x on the regular multiplier. Before then, don't worry too much about bonus score; after then, and especially if double scoring is active from 1-2-3-4-5, it would be very wise not to tilt. There is no holdover for base bonus or multiplier, and there is no mid-ball bonus collect.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>In competition/novelty play, specials score 50,000 points. There are no extra balls at all; however, the Special and the replay score award can be set to give a timed bonus ball at the end of the game.</p>

<p>The multiball timer can be set to anywhere from 15 to 99 seconds.</p>

<p>Drain Shield can be entirely disabled.</p>

<p>NOTE: it is never safe to let a ball go on this game for an invalid playfield even if you did not think any switches were hit on the way down. As the ball transitions from the shooter lane to the upper right flipper, a small rollover scores 10 points and validates the playfield. If you drain, you will not get the ball back.</p>
