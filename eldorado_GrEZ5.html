<h1>El Dorado (Gottlieb, 1975)</h1>

<p>This same playfield layout was used in all of the following games: Gold Strike, Lucky Strike, Target Alpha, Solar City, Canada Dry, El Dorado City of Gold. Make sure you didn't intend to read about one of those.</p>


<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Hit lit drop targets. If the lights are in front of drop targets that are down, use the star rollover in the center of the table to change which targets are lit. Focus only on lit drop targets.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Lanes</h3>

<p>There are 10 in the game: three in the upper right, two in the middle right, one in the upper left, and the four in+out lanes. Exactly one will be lit for 5,000 points. Unlit lanes score 500 points. The center star rollover and near left standup target rotate which one is lit.</p>

<h3>Drop targets</h3>

<p>Unlit drop targets score 500 points. Lit drop targets score 5,000 points. The center star rollover and near left standup target rotate which drop targets are lit. Only one drop target in each bank can be lit at a time. Both drop target banks are reset only when both are completed; this scores 5,000 points and a possible instant special depending on game settings. After all 15 drop targets have been hit at least once, lit drop targets in the upper bank only score a special alongside the 5,000 points.</p>

<h3>Other features</h3>

<p>Center star rollover: 1,000 points and rotate which targets/lanes are lit.</p>

<p>Bumper: 1,000 points.</p>

<p>Far left standup target: 1,000 points.</p>

<p>Near left standup target: 100 points and rotates which lanes/targets are lit.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>El Dorado has a conventional in/out lane setup. The four in and out lanes act like any other rollover lane on the playfield scoring 500 points or 5,000 when lit.</p>

<p>There is no end of ball bonus.</p>
