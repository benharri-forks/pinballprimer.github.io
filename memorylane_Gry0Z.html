<h1 style="color:blue;">Memory Lane (Stern Electronics, 1978)</h1>

<br>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>If the spinners spin well, light the spinners on the in lanes and shoot them all day. If the spinners don't spin well, focus first on completing strikes at lit drop target banks or all lit rollovers, and multiply bonus at the left saucer then the back saucer. <br>Extra ball becomes available at the left spinner after 3X bonus, and special is available at the standup targets after a certain number of strikes.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Saucers</h3>

<p>Both saucers score 5,000 points. At the beginning of the ball, the left saucer is lit for double bonus. Once 2X bonus has been collected, the top saucer lights for triple bonus. Once 3X bonus has been collected, the left saucer lights for Light Extra Ball. The triple bonus can be set to alternate on and off with 10-point switch hits. The extra ball can be disabled entirely, but cannot be set to points.</p>

<h3>Spinners</h3>

<p>Both spinners score 100 points per spin at the start of each ball. Going through either in lane lights the spinner on the same side for 1,000/spin for the rest of the ball.</p>

<p>The left spinner has the left saucer on the way, but a flip to this lane is likely too strong to land in the saucer directly, so landing in the left saucer a slow shot or lucky bounce out of the pop bumpers.<br>The shape of the right spinner lane as it intersects the plunge path is not very intuitive for directing the ball back up to the top of the playfield, so expect a shot to the right spinner to choke up in the very top right of the playfield and return through the spinner.</p>

<h3>Rollover buttons, center drop targets, strikes, and bonus</h3>

<p>There are 10 rollover buttons in a triangle shape meant to represent bowling pins. Rolling over a button unlights it. Rolling over all 10 scores a strike. A strike is also scored if the 3-bank of center drop targets is completed while the white X in front is lit; this light toggles every time the current score is a multiple of 20.<br>On their own, drop targets score 500 each and 3,000 per completion.</p>

<p>End of ball bonus is equal to 1,000 points per hit rollover on the current pin set, plus 10,000 points per strike, all multiplied by the bonus multiplier.  Up to 7 strikes can be scored; completing an 8th strike awards 10,000 points directly. Lighting a certain number of strikes (3, 4, 5, or 6, depending on settings) lights the standup targets around the playfield for special.</p>

<h3>Standup targets</h3>

<p>There are 4 around the playfield; two at the top near the bumpers, and two on either side near the bottom of the playfield. They score 500 points each. Once the requisite number of strikes are lit, these standup targets are lit for a special rotating between the four.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the playfield</h3>

<p>Memory Lane has a conventional in/out lane setup. In lanes score 500 points and light the spinner on the same side. Out lanes score 5,000 points and can be lit for extra ball by entering the left saucer after 3X bonus has been collected.</p>

<h3>Settings and miscellanea</h3>

<p>The number of strikes required to light the standup target specials can be set to 3, 4, 5, or 6.</p>

<p>Extra balls cannot be worth points. They are either on or off. When extra ball is on, it can be set to light at both in lanes at once or alternate between the two.</p>

<p>Special can be worth extra ball, free game, extra ball AND free game, or 100,000 points. Special can be set to max out at 1 earned per ball in play, or open ended.</p>

<p>The light that determines whether completing the drop targets spots a strike can be set to toggle every time the score is a multiple of 20, or every time the score is a multiple of 40.</p>
