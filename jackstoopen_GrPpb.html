<h1 style="text-align:center">Jacks to Open (Mylstar/Gottlieb, 1984)</h1>

<p>This is a remake of Jacks Open (Gottlieb, EM, 1977).</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>Collect the diamond and heart lanes on plunges, as they'll be helpful later, but when the ball is on the flippers, make it a priority to advance up the bonus ladder by clearing the combinations of drop targets that are lit. Bonus is 10,000 points per lit card in the bonus ladder, which is doubled after completing the royal flush. Additional completely royal flushes give extra ball and special. Once you're bored of shooting drop targets, try to ricochet your way to the top of the table, because the star bumpers that get lit by the diamond and heart lanes score 10,000 points per bump.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>Top lanes always score 5,000 points. The diamond lights the left bumper for 10,000 points and the left out lane for 50,000 points. The spade lights the left side lane and in lane for "super score", which is just 5,000 points instead of 500. The club lights the right side lane and in lane for super score. The heart lights the right pop bumper for 10,000 points and the right out lane for 50,000 points. There is no award given for earning all 4 suits.</p>

<h3>Pop bumpers</h3>

<p>The center bumper always scores 1,000 points. The outer bumpers score 100 points, or 10,000 (!) when lit as described above.</p>

<h3>Drop targets, including bonus and bonus multiplier</h3>

<p>The 9 drop targets are ordered A-K-K-Q-Q-Q-J-J-10 from left to right, which is similar to the Royal Flush games and different from the original electromechanical Jacks Open. Any drop target down scores 5,000 points. Completing the drop targets indicated on the table lights them and advances you to the next set. Level 1 needs the two jacks; level 2 needs the three queens; level 3 needs a full house of queens and kings; at level 4 and on, only the five red targets appear, and these targets form an A-K-Q-J-10 royal flush. If you make it part of the way through a level and drain, your progress is saved, so you won't necessarily need to complete all the drop targets in the set to complete the level. The first completion of the royal flush lights double bonus for the rest of the game; additional completions of the royal flush on the same ball score an extra ball, then specials. Lit playing cards at all levels of the bonus ladder score 10,000 points for the end of ball bonus. Max bonus is 2x 150,000 = 300,000 points. Bonus and bonus multipliers always carry from ball to ball. There is no mid-ball bonus collect.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>Jacks to Open has a conventional in/out lane setup. However, part of the in lane rail is cut off, allowing a ball to roll up the flipper and fall out the back of the in lane. In lanes score 500 points, or 5,000 when lit by the spade (left) or club (right) top lanes. Out lanes score 5,000 points or 50,000 when lit by the diamond (left) or heart (right) top lanes.</p>

<p>There is a center post between the flippers. Originally, this post was quite large with a decently thick rubber on it, so it was actually surprisingly helpful for saving possible center drains.</p>
