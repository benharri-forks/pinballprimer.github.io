<h1>Groovy / Crescendo / Psychedelic (Gottlieb, 1970)</h1>

<p>Groovy is the 4-player version. Crescendo is the 2-player version. Psychedelic is the 1-player version produced primarily for European export. All three have identical rules as far as I have found.</p>

<h2>Quick strategy synopsis</h2>

<p>The center bumper increases the Flower Power value: 10-20-30-40-50, then 100-200-300-400-500, then back to 10. Nothing matters for scoring anywhere in the game unless the Flower Power value is high. Hit the center bumper until the Flower Power value is high- preferably at least 300- then avoid it like the plague. Drop targets and any lit lane score the Flower Power value. More lanes are lit as the game goes on. Clearing the drop targets resets them and scores a 500 point bonus.</p>

<br>

<h2>Shots and table features</h2>

<h3>Top lanes</h3>

<p>The center top lane scores 10 points or 100 when lit, and is only lit on ball 1. The other four lanes score 5 points when not lit or the current Flower Power value when lit. The leftmost lane is lit on balls 2-5; The rightmost lane is lit on balls 3-5; the second lane from left is lit on balls 4-5; the second lane from right is lit on ball 5 only.</p>

<h3>Bumpers</h3>

<p>The center bumper scores 10 points, or 100 when lit. Whether lit or not, the center bumper rotates the Flower Power value with each hit: 10-20-30-40-50-100-200-300-400-500, then back to 10. <br>The two yellow bumpers on either side of the center red bumper and the two green bumpers directly above the out lanes score 1 point, or 10 points when lit. At any time, either the center bumper or all 4 other bumpers will be lit; this alternates every time a player's score crosses a 100-point threshold.</p>

<h3>Flower lanes</h3>

<p>Unlit flower lanes and targets always score 5 points. Lit flower lanes and targets score the current Flower Power value. Once a flower lane/target is lit, it stays lit for the rest of the game. In addition to the flower top lanes described above, features light as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Ball 1 (always lit): the out lanes and middle right side lane, which also serves as a gate back to the shooter lane</li>
	<li>Ball 2: the upper right side lane</li>
	<li>Ball 3: the upper left side lane</li>
	<li>Ball 4: middle left side lane</li>
	<li>Ball 5: the lower standup targets</li>
</ul>
<p>Flower Power value always starts at 10 points at the beginning of a game, but does not reset between balls or players. Thus, it may be an advantage to play Groovy/Crescendo as late as possible in the player order for a multiplayer setting.</p>

<h3>Drop targets</h3>

<p>Each drop target down scores the current Flower Power value. Completing the bank will reset all five targets and award a 500 point bonus. Drop targets always reset from ball to ball.</p>

<h3>Bottom of the table</h3>

<p>If you've seen the much more common game Old Chicago, you'll know mostly how the bottom of this table looks. Just behind the hinge of the two flippers is a nearly vertical wall, and behind that is the out lane. Out lanes are flower lanes which are always lit. Just above the out lanes are the green pop bumpers, ready to bop the ball straight downward. Keeping the ball in the center of the table, horizontally speaking, is always in your best interest where possible.</p>

<p>There are no extra balls, specials, or end of ball bonus points.</p>
